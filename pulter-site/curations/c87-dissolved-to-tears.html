      Pulter calls the dying hart “quite dissolved,” and the emblem’s speaker imagines herself dissolving “to tears.” The words “dissolve” and “dissolution” appear frequently in Pulter’s poetry. She rhymes them with “resolve,” “revolve” (one of many terms about planets and lives circling about), and “involve” (which she uses to mean coil around or enwrap, another circular image). Many of her poems—such as <a href="/poems/105" title="Read “View But This Tulip” (Emblem 40)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">View But This Tulip (Emblem 40)</span><span class="idx">105</span></a>—imagine people, nature, or the universe dissolving in a similar way as John Donne uses the term in “The Dissolution.” Pulter’s tulip emblem and Donne’s poem might help us understand what she means when she refers to the deer as nearly dissolved. What might this use of “dissolve” suggest about Pulter’s view of death and the afterlife?

      Pulter also uses “dissolve” to describe excessive crying; in Emblem 22, the speaker says, “I to tears dissolve.” <a href="/poems/17" title="Read “The Circle [1]” (Poem 17)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Circle [1]</span><span class="idx">17</span></a> and <a href="/poems/63" title="Read “Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down” (Poem 63)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down</span><span class="idx">63</span></a> both contemplate what would happen if the speaker dissolved into tears, and <a href="/poems/13" title="Read “Upon the Imprisonment of His Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First” (Poem 13)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Upon the Imprisonment of His Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First</span><span class="idx">13</span></a> ends with this stanza:

      Two useful intertexts for Pulter’s trope of dissolving into tears are John Donne’s sermon on Psalm 6, preached at Whitehall on April 5, 1628, and Henry Vaughan’s poem “The Lamp.”

        And this may be some emblem, some useful intimation, how hastily repentance follows sin; David’s sin is placed, but in the beginning of the night in the evening (in the evening he rose and walked upon the terrace and saw Bathsheba) and in the next part of time in the night, he falls a weeping: no more between the sweetness of sin, and the bitterness of repentance, than between evening and night; no morning to either of them, till the sun of grace arise and shine out and proceed to a meridional height, and make the repentance upon circumstance, to be a repentance upon the substance, and bring it to be a repentance for the sin itself, which at first was but a repentance upon some calamity, that that sin induced.
      </p>

        He wept then and wept in the night; in a time, when he could neither receive rest in himself, which all men had, nor receive praise from others, which all men affect. And he wept <span class="it">omni nocte</span>; which is not only <span class="it">omnibus noctibus</span>, some time every night, but it is <span class="it">tota nocte</span>, clean through the night. And he wept in that abundance, as hath put the Holy Ghost to that hyperbole in David’s pen to express it, <span class="it">liquefecit stratum, natare fecit stratum</span>, it drowned his bed, surrounded his bed, it dissolved, it macerated, it melted his bed with that brine. Well; <span class="it">qui rigat stratum</span>, he that washes his bed so with repentant tears, <span class="it">non potest in cogitationem ejus libidinum pompa subrepere</span>. Tentations [temptations] take hold of us sometimes after our tears, after our repentance, but seldom or never in the act of our repentance, and in the very shedding of our tears; at least <span class="it">libidinum pompa</span>, the victory, the triumph of lust breaks not in upon us, in a bed, so dissolved, so surrounded, so macerated with such tears. Thy bed is a figure of thy grave. Such as thy grave receives thee at death, it shall deliver thee up to judgement at last. Such as thy bed receives thee at night, it shall deliver thee in the morning. If thou sleep without calling thyself to an account, thou wilt wake so, and walk so, and proceed so, without ever calling thyself to an account, till Christ Jesus call thee in the clouds. It is not intended, that thou shouldest afflict thyself so grievously, as some overdoing penitents, to put chips and shells and splints and flints and nails and rowels [small spiked wheels attached to spurs] of spurs in thy bed, to wound and macerate thy body so. The inventions of men are not intended here. But here is a precept of God, implied in this precedent and practice of David: that as long as the sense of a former sin, or the inclination to a future oppresses thee, thou must not close thine eyes, thou must not take thy rest, till, as God married thy body and soul together in the creation, and shall at last crown thy body and soul together in the resurrection, so they may also rest together here, that as thy body rests in thy bed, thy soul may rest in the peace of thy conscience, and that thou never say to thy head, rest upon this pillow, till thou canst say to thy soul, rest in this repentance, in this peace.
