  Pulter’s poem ends with a promise that after the Final Judgment and Resurrection, “we shall know (without which all is none) / The eternal essence, even as we are known” (ll. 58–59). But what did it mean to “know” the eternal essence, or God, in the seventeenth century? Robert Herrick’s terse couplet, the entirety of his poem “What God Is,” succinctly summarizes one position on this question:

  Herrick has other poems in which he dwells on the impossibility of ever knowing God, as in his poem “To Find God”:

  Margaret Cavendish, a poet writing at roughly the same time as Pulter, also frequently takes the position that it is best not to ask after questions that can’t be answered, including cosmological questions (as in her poem “Of Stars”) as well as theological questions (as in her poem “Great God from Thee All Infinites Do Flow,” which ends, “But since none knows the great Creator, must / Man seek no more, but in his greatness trust.”).

  While Cavendish frequently concludes that the limits of the human mind forever prohibit us from accessing truly divine knowledge, Neo-Platonic poets like Thomas Traherne imagine their mind as transcending the body. Traherne’s poem “The Consummation,” much like Pulter’s “Perfection of Patience and Knowledge,” moves from what we can know in this realm to what we will know “in a glorious day” (l. 41; the Final Judgment?), though unlike Pulter’s poem, “The Consummation” begins not with images of the resurrection but with the transcendence of the mind.

  I will end this curation with another Cavendish poem, her “Motion of Thoughts,” which will help shine new light on Pulter’s “Perfection of Patience and Knowledge.” While Traherne’s poem replaces bodily resurrection with transcendence, Cavendish’s poem focuses our attention not just on divine knowledge, but also on the status of the body, or soul, who is capable of “knowing” anything at the Final Judgment. If Pulter’s poem has an explicit reference to 1 Corinthians 13:12, Cavendish’s gloss on the biblical verse is more implicit; Cavendish is also perversely physicalist when she says that even though St. Paul promises that we will see God with our eyes, the bodies that resurrect may be so radically different that this may be only a figure of speech (ll. 57–62). If Pulter’s poem gestures to a fantasy of knowledge, Cavendish’s ends by bringing her readers crashing back to earth: “all the wise and learnèd cannot tell / What’s done in Heaven, or how we there shall dwell” (ll. 67–68).

    <li class="l">Musing one time alone, mine eyes being fixed</li>
    <li class="l">Upon the ground, my sight with gravel mixed,</li>
    <li class="l">My feet did walk without direction’s guide;</li>
    <li class="l">My thoughts did travel far and wander wide.</li>
    <li class="l">At last they chanced upon a hill to climb,</li>
    <li class="l">And being there, saw things that were divine.</li>
    <li class="l t-2">First, what they saw: a glorious light did blaze,</li>
    <li class="l">Whose splendor made it painful for the gaze.</li>
    <li class="l">No separations nor shadows by stops made,</li>
    <li class="l">No darkness did obstruct this light with shade.</li>
    <li class="l">This light had no dimension, nor no bound,</li>
    <li class="l">No limits, but it filled all places round.</li>
    <li class="l">Always in motion ’twas, yet fixed did prove,</li>
    <li class="l">Like to the twinkling stars, which never move.</li>
    <li class="l">This motion working, running several ways,</li>
    <li class="l">Seemed as if contradictions it would raise,</li>
    <li class="l">For with itself it seemed not to agree,</li>
    <li class="l">Like to a skein of thread, if’t knotted be.</li>
    <li class="l">For some did go straight in an even line,</li>
    <li class="l">But some again did cross, and some did twine.</li>
    <li class="l">Yet at the last, all several motions run</li>
    <li class="l">Into the first Prime Motion, which begun.</li>
    <li class="l">In various forms and shapes did life run through,</li>
    <li class="l">Which was eternal, but the shapes were new;</li>
    <li class="l">No sooner made, but quickly passed away,</li>
    <li class="l">Yet while they were, they did desire to stay.</li>
    <li class="l">But motion to one form can ne’er constant be,</li>
    <li class="l">For life, which motion is, joys in variety.</li>
    <li class="l">For the First Motion everything can make,</li>
    <li class="l">But cannot add unto itself, nor take.</li>
    <li class="l">Indeed no other matter could it frame:</li>
    <li class="l">Itself was all, and in itself the same.</li>
    <li class="l">Perceiving now this fixèd point of light,</li>
    <li class="l">I spied a union: Knowledge, Power, and Might,</li>
    <li class="l">Wisdom, Truth, Justice, Providence, all one,</li>
    <li class="l">No attribute was by itself alone.</li>
    <li class="l">Not like to several lines drawn to one point,</li>
    <li class="l">For what doth meet may be again disjoint.</li>
    <li class="l">But this same point, from whence all lines did flow,</li>
    <li class="l">Nought can diminish it, or make it grow.</li>
    <li class="l">’Tis its own center and circumference round,</li>
    <li class="l">Yet neither has a limit nor a bound.</li>
    <li class="l">A fixed eternity, and so will last:</li>
    <li class="l">All present is, nothing to come or past.</li>
    <li class="l">A fixed perfection; nothing can add more;</li>
    <li class="l">All things is it, and itself doth adore.</li>
    <li class="l">My thoughts then wondering at what they did see,</li>
    <li class="l">Found at the last themselves the same to be,</li>
    <li class="l">Yet were so small a branch, as they could not</li>
    <li class="l">Know whence they sprung, nor how they were begot.</li>
    <li class="l t-2">Some say, all that we know of Heaven above</li>
    <li class="l">Is that we joy, and that we love.</li>
    <li class="l">But who can tell that? For all we know,</li>
    <li class="l">Those passions we call joy and love below</li>
    <li class="l">May by excess such other passions grow;</li>
    <li class="l">None in the world is capable to know.</li>
    <li class="l">Just like our bodies, although they shall rise,</li>
    <li class="l">And as St. Paul says, see God with our eyes,</li>
    <li class="l">Yet may we in the change such difference find,</li>
    <li class="l">Both in our bodies, and also in mind,</li>
    <li class="l">As if we never had been of mankind,</li>
    <li class="l">And that these eyes we see with now were blind.</li>
    <li class="l">Say we can measure all the planets high,</li>
    <li class="l">And number all the stars be in the sky,</li>
    <li class="l">And we can circle all the world about,</li>
    <li class="l">And can find all th’effects of nature out:</li>
    <li class="l">Yet all the wise and learnèd cannot tell</li>
    <li class="l">What’s done in Heaven, or how we there shall dwell.</li>
