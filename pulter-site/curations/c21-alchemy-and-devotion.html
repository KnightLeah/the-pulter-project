  While alchemy and Christianity might seem to us to be incompatible frameworks of belief, the early modern period saw much writing in the area of spiritual alchemy, in which the physical processes of alchemy became metaphors for the purification of the soul. Pulter’s poetry shows her interest in this amalgamation, while also retaining a clear interest in the distinctive terms, materials, processes and value systems in each set of beliefs. In both Donne’s sermons  and George Herbert’s poetry we can see their use of alchemical imagery for religious purposes, including their use of specific terms which Pulter also adopted such as “calcine.” Excerpts from essays by James R. Keller and Jayne Archer explain the resonance of alchemy for Donne and Pulter, respectively.

      [M]an is the theme of spiritual alchemy. The series of correspondences that define the Elizabethan perception of the universe are a fundamental part of the hermetic experiments. The philosopher’s stone in its relationship to base metal corresponds to Christ’s salvation of humanity, each having the capacity to transform that which is inferior to itself to spiritual perfection … Death parallels the stages known as putrefaction and mortification in the hermetic experiment. The metal putrefying in the limbeck (the alchemical still) is considered dead, its soul having been removed in the first stage of the process. However, with the advent of the noble tincture, the soul of the metal is resurrected, completing the transmutation. Christ exercises the same power over the spirits of humanity as the noble tincture levies against base metals. Donne illustrates this similarity in the language of “Death’s Duel,” where he invites the audience to undergo transmutation through the magical, alchemical qualities of Christ’s blood.

        I have seen Minute-glasses; Glasses so short-liv’d. If I were to preach upon this Text, to such a glass, it were enough for half the Sermon; enough to show the wordly man his Treasure, and the Object of his heart (<span class="it">for, where your Treasure is, there will your Heart be also</span>) to call his eye to that Minute-glass, and to tell him, There flows, there flies your Treasure, and your Heart with it. But if I had a Secular Glass, a Glass that would run an age, if the two Hemispheres of the World were composed in the form of such a Glass, and all the World calcin’d and burnt to ashes, and all the ashes, and sands, and atoms of the World put into that Glass, it would not be enough to tell the godly man what his Treasure, and the Object of his Heart is.

          <span class="it">‘A “Perfect Circle”? Alchemy in the Poetry of Hester Pulter’</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The renewed interest in alchemy during the Interregnum resulted in part from the fact that alchemy is a discourse of change, metamorphosis and revolution. Examining the relationship between spirit and matter, and of the limits of human efforts to reform both themselves and the material world, alchemy provided a perfect vehicle through which to articulate, examine and understand the experience and ethics of political and religious change. [p. 1]
      </p>
      <p>
        In line 10 of the poem we discover that the philtre to be used in the union of mercury and sulphur is the process of calcination. In the alchemical opus calcination commonly follows the <span class="it">nigredo</span>, the initial breaking down of matter into its constituent parts. Calcination involves rapid, intense and dry heating in a sealed vessel, reducing the matter to calx or dust. In practical or experimental alchemy, the purpose behind this process is to make the <span class="it">prima materia</span> porous, ready for the introduction of a liquid, in the stage called the <span class="it">solutio</span>. In spiritual alchemy, calcination represents the reduction of the human soul to a state of utter despair, when she might be most receptive to the influx of divine spirit. It is in this latter sense that calcination was used in religious writings as a metaphor for the <span class="it">nigredo</span> of mortal life: in the temporal physical world we await the death that will enable us to be born again in the eternal spiritual world. This liminal state, fraught with the temptation to despair, fear and doubt, is a challenge to interpretation and to faith. In “Meditation II,” Donne uses calcination to explore this test: “he feeles that a <span class="it">Feuer</span> doth not melt him like <span class="it">snow</span>, but powr him out like lead, like yron, like brasse melted in a furnace: It doth not only <span class="it">melt</span> him, but <span class="it">Calcine</span> him, reduce him to <span class="it">Atomes</span>, and to <span class="it">ashes</span>; not to <span class="it">water</span>, but to <span class="it">lime</span>.” Experiencing hunger, pain, desire, grief, decay and eventually death, the human being, like the alchemist’s <span class="it">prima materia</span>, is subjected to the <span class="it">nigredo</span> and <span class="it">calcinatio</span>, uncertain whether he or she is anything but a body. The challenge to the alchemist and to the poet, is to understand these physical processes as signs of correlative transformations in our spiritual natures.
      </p>

        Like “circle,” “calcin’d” is another highly-charged and potent term to which Pulter returns in her poetry, precisely so that she can map and explore her fluctuating ambivalent feelings about life and death, matter and spirit. Mostly, as in “The Circle,” calcination is used in a negative context, coupled with the terms “obliviated,” “dust” and “ashes” to describe the finality of death. But there is hope. In another of her poems, “The Perfecsion of Patience and Knowledg,” Pulter couples calcination with another alchemical process, sublimation, in order to contrast the spiritual and physical worlds. [pp. 5-6]
