                    In pre-modern and early-modern Europe, bells were ubiquitous and the loudest, most pervasive sound in cities. After the human voice, bells were the most versatile of the instruments available and so were used extensively, both by churches for religious reasons, calling listeners to mass or marking a feast day, and by civic buildings (city halls) for secular reasons, such as timekeeping or alarm signaling.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-1" id="fna-1-1">1</a>

                    Bells are extremely versatile instruments that can convey many different meanings, to which early modern listeners were attuned. Bells not only are cast to sound different pitches, but also can be played in various styles. Today, most people think of ‘tolling’, ‘ringing’, and ‘striking’ as synonyms for sounding a bell, but in the early-modern period, these were recognized as distinct playing techniques that produced different qualities of sound.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-2" id="fna-1-2">2</a> European bells also have an unusually complex overtone structure (with a characteristic minor third overtone), which is somewhat variant across bell foundries, permitting an expansive range of sounds. Individual bells can therefore be distinguished because each produces a distinct sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While bell ringing varied somewhat between Protestant and Catholic churches, both used the ‘passing bell,’ to which John Donne refers when he says “ask not for whom the bell tolls”; this is also the bell to which Hester Pulter refers in “The Welcome”.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-3" id="fna-1-3">3</a> The passing bell was tolled just before a person’s death to ward off evil and to call for listeners to pray for the departing soul.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-4" id="fna-1-4">4</a> The manner in which a bell was tolled could tell the listener about who was passing: “two pulls for a woman, three for a man was common in England and France.” Bells were a significant cost for churches and bell ringing was their greatest source of income; because bell tolling and ringing could be purchased, with smaller bells costing less money and bigger bells costing more, the audience could tell not only the gender of the person for whom the bell was tolling but also their class. In a small town, it would have been possible to deduce literally for whom the bell tolled from its distinct sound and pattern.

                <p>Across pre-modern and early-modern Europe, bells were used for many purposes, including superstition, such as driving away thunderstorms. During the Reformation, bells became associated with Catholicism and there were many calls to limit when and how bells were used, including for funeral rites. Despite pressure to eliminate funeral tolling altogether, bells remained integral parts of the services of the dead throughout the period. The following is excerpted from Elizabeth I’s instructions on the administration of the Sacraments, in which she authorizes and limits bell tolling in death ceremonies to the passing bell, the death bell, and the funeral bell.</p>

                    The following meditation is the source of Donne’s famous line: “And therefore neuer send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.” The meditation emphasizes community and the connections between people: when one community member dies, so too does a portion of those who are left living. The tolling of the passing bell is also a reminder of one’s mortality.

                        PErchance hee for whom this <span class="it">Bell</span> tolls, may bee so ill, as that he knowes not it <span class="it">tolls</span> for him; And perchance I may thinke my selfe so much better than I am, as that they who are about mee, and see my state, may haue caused it to toll for mee, and I know not that. The <span class="it">Church</span> is <span class="it">Catholike</span>, <span class="it">vniuersall</span>, so are all her <span class="it">Actions</span>, <span class="it">All</span> that she does, belongs to <span class="it">all</span>. When she <span class="it">baptizes a child</span>, that action concernes mee; for that child is thereby connected to that <span class="it">Head</span> which is my <span class="it">Head</span> too, and engraffed into that <span class="it">body</span>, whereof I am a <span class="it">member</span>. And when she <span class="it">buries a Man</span>, that action concernes me; All <span class="it">mankinde</span> is of one <span class="it">Author</span>; and is one <span class="it">volume</span>; when one Man dies, one <span class="it">Chapter</span> is not <span class="it">torne</span> out of the <span class="it">booke</span>, but <span class="a">translated</span> into a better <span class="it">language</span>; and euery <span class="it">Chapter</span> must be so <span class="it">translated</span>; <span class="it">God</span> emploies seuerall <span class="it">translators</span>; some peeces are translated by <span class="it">Age</span>, some by <span class="it">sicknesse</span>, some by <span class="it">warre</span>, some by <span clas="it">iustice</span>; but <span class="it">Gods</span> hand is in euery <span class="it">translation</span>; and his hand shall binde vp all our scattered leaues againe, for that <span class="it">Librarie</span> where euery <span class="it">booke</span> shall lie open to one another: As therefore the <span class="it">Bell</span> that rings to a <span class="it">Sermon</span>, calls not vpon the <span class="it">Preacher</span> onely, but vpon the <span class="it">Congregation</span> to come; so this <span class="it">Bell</span> calls vs all: but how much more <span class="it">mee</span>, who am brought so neere the <span class="it">doore</span> by this <span class="it">sicknesse</span>. There was a <span class="it">contention</span> as farre as a <span class="it">suite</span>, (in which both <span class="it">pietie</span> and <span class="it">dignitie</span>, <span class="it">religion</span>, and <span class="it">estimation</span>, were mingled) which of the religious <span class="it">Orders</span> should ring to <span class="it">praiers</span> first in the <span class="it">Morning</span>; and it was <span class="it">determined</span>, that <span class="it">they should ring first that rose earliest</span>. If we vnderstand aright the <span class="it">dignitie</span> of this Bell, that tolls for our <span class="it">euening prayer</span>, wee would bee glad to make it ours, by rising early, in that <span class="it">application</span>, that it might bee ours, as wel as his, whose indeed it is. The <span class="it">Bell</span> doth toll for him that <span class="it">thinkes</span> it doth; and though it <span class="it">intermit</span> againe, yet from that <span class="it">minute</span>, that that occasion wrought vpon him, hee is vnited to <span class="it">God</span>. Who casts not vp his <span class="it">Eie</span> to the <span class="it">Sunne</span> when it rises? but who takes off his <span class="it">Eie</span> from a <span class="it">Comet</span>, when that breakes out? who bends not his <span class="it">eare</span> to any <span class="it">bell</span>, which vpon any occasion rings? but who can remoue it from that <span class="it">bell</span>, which is passing a <span class="it">peece of himselfe</span> out of this <span class="it">world</span>? No Man is an <span class="it">Iland</span>, intire of it selfe; euery man is a peece of the <span class="it">Continent</span>, a part of the <span class="it">maine</span>; if a <span class="it">Clod</span> bee washed away by the <span class="it">Sea, Europe</span> is the lesse, as well as if a <span class="it">Promontorie</span> were, as well as if a <span class="it">Mannor</span> of thy <span class="it">friends</span>, or of <span class="it">thine owne</span> were; Any Mans <span class="it">death</span> diminishes <span class="it">me</span>, because I am inuolued in <span class="it">Mankinde</span>; And therefore neuer send to know for whom the <span class="it">bell</span> tolls; It tolls for <span class="it">thee</span>. Neither can we call this a <span class="it">begging</span> of <span class="it">Miserie</span> or a <span class="it">borrowing</span> of <span class="it">Miserie</span>, as though we were not miserable enough of our selues, but must fetch in more from the next house, in taking vpon vs the <span class="it">Miserie</span> of our <span class="it">Neighbours</span>. Truly it were an excusable <span class="it">couetousnesse</span> if wee did; for <span class="it">affliction</span> is a <span class="it">treasure</span>, and scarce any Man hath <span class="it">enough</span> of it. No Man hath <span class="it">affliction</span> enough, that is not matured, and ripened by it, and made fit for <span class="it">God</span> by that <span class="it">affliction</span>. If a Man carry <span class="it">treasure</span> in <span class="it">bullion</span>, or in a <span class="it">wedge</span> of <span class="it">gold</span>, and haue none coined into <span class="it">currant Monies</span>, his <span class="it">treasure</span> will not defray him as he trauells. <span class="it">Tribulation</span> is <span class="it">Treasure</span> in the <span class="it">nature</span> of it, but it is not <span class="it">currant money</span> in the <span class="it">vse</span> of it, except wee get nearer and nearer our <span class="it">home, heauen</span>, by it. Another Man may be <span class="it">sicke</span> too, and sicke to <span class="it">death</span>, and this <span class="it">affliction</span> may lie in his <span class="it">bowels</span>, as <span class="it">gold</span> in a <span class="it">Mine</span>, and be of no vse to him; but this <span class="it">bell</span> that tels mee of his <span class="it">affliction</span>, digs out, and applies that <span class="it">gold</span> to <span class="it">mee</span>. if by this consideration of anothers danger, I take mine owne into Contemplation, and so secure my selfe, by making my recourse to my <span class="it">God</span>, who is our onely securitie.
