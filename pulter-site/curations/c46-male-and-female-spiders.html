    <p>In her poem “Of the Spider,” Margaret Cavendish distinguishes between the tasks of the female house spider and the male spider who hunts abroad. She uses the language of weaving but depicts the location and all of the equipment (the shop, the wheel, the distaff) as inside the spider’s body. The house of ropes and nets in which she sits is one of her own making, with the sinister purpose of holding the weight of bodies, her prey. The male spider similarly ensnares prey, but outside in the natural world. Cavendish compares him to a host who violates the laws of hospitality by killing his guests, again using domestic imagery.</p>
