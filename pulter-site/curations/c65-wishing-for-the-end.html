      In the seventeenth century, belief in resurrection meant belief that bodies would be re-formed and reunited with their souls at the Final Judgment. The belief in resurrection therefore makes death temporary; hence Donne’s famous holy sonnet “Death be not proud” ends with the following taunting couplet: “One short sleep past, we wake eternally, / And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die” (ll. 13–14; from <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/sonnet10.htm" target="_blank">Luminarium</a>). Other poets, however, sometimes write poems that imagine happiness not as the death of death, but as the finality of death. If Donne’s “Death be not proud” sits at one pole of a spectrum, Abraham Cowley’s poem “All Over, Love” sits at the other. In it, he imagines the finality of death as the ultimate comfort. The larger conceit of the poem is that he is not so lucky as to “know” a time in his life “when he shall not be so [alive],” because his love is so powerful that it will animate his body long after his death, until Love brings his body back together in a kind of parody of the Final Judgment.

      Abraham Cowley’s “All Over, Love” offers a moving (and slightly haunting) vision of an afterlife where the strength of one’s emotion can prevent any meaningful rest; his “passions” are what lead to the ersatz afterlife in his poem, and what cause him in turn to voice a yearning for a death that marks a complete end of life. Though Cowley’s poem revolves around a clever poetic conceit, he is not the only author in this century to imagine death as final. The rise of Epicurean philosophy in the seventeenth century saw an explosion of writers not only writing about atoms and atomism (and it may be useful here to remember that Pulter sometimes conflates “dust” and atoms), but also wondering whether there may not be any supernatural or transcendent realms beyond ours. John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, gives poetic voice to these Epicurean ideas in his translation of Seneca’s <span class="it">Troas</span>:

      Rochester’s translation, above, is perhaps the bleakest version of Epicureanism; the same impulse, however, also contributes to carpe diem poetry. If this world is all we have, carpe diem poets often argued, then we should be maximizing the pleasures of <span class="it">this world</span> rather than orienting our actions towards a potentially non-existent afterlife. It also leads to such witty works of nihilism as “Upon Nothing,” Rochester’s great metaphysical reflection on the power that nothingness holds.
