      Devotional poetry flourished in English and related literatures after the Reformation, as Barbara Lewalski explored in a still-foundational study. Lewalski describes the way in which “the new focus on scripture occasioned by the Protestant Reformation” generated “the remarkable flowering of the religious lyric in the seventeenth century,” and goes on to say:

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Besides looking to the Bible as source and model for the presentation of sacred truth as art, Protestant poetics also calls for the treatment of another kind of truth in religious lyric poetry—the painstaking analysis of the personal religious life. Working in these terms, the Protestant lyric poet must explore such questions as his [sic] relationship to God, the state of his soul, and his hopes of salvation with direct reference to his own theological assumptions.

      The devotional lyric was also a literary mode relatively accessible for women readers and writers. Femke Molekamp, discussing a devotional poem by the Scottish Presbyterian poet Elizabeth Melville, summarises in a way that could apply directly to Pulter’s poem:

        [Melville’s poem] exemplifies many common features of early modern female religious poetry, and of the devotional practices to which it is connected. First, the poem is anchored in scripture, and, second, it is written in a meditative mode. The devotional life of early modern women was marked by reading practices that were often meditative and affective, in the pursuit of divine inspiration. Biographical sources reveal that many literate godly women took time on a daily basis to retreat to a more solitary space to engage in devotional reading, textually based meditation, and prayer, and there are also many extant books of meditation written by and for women of this era.
