      Pulter’s speakers often remind themselves and readers that death is both inevitable and a fervently desired transition. Many of Pulter’s speakers lament how they—and so many other humans—waste their time in what Pulter calls “fruitless grief” and Margaret Cavendish here calls “foolish ambition.”

    If the soul, as they say, be the very life, or have all life in itself, and the body but its instrument, then the body now hath no more life in it, than when it is reduced to the earth, but is as dead as a door-nail, and so at the resurrection cannot be raised from death. For that which never had life, cannot be raised from death; and the union of it to the soul at the resurrection they fabulate on [invent stories about], is but an addition of corpulency or gross matter to the soul, which in truth is no resurrection at all from the dead, no more than the restoration of flesh lost by famine, sickness, &c. For resurrection from the death, is not the addition of gross matter to life, but the restoration of life from death. So that the restitution of lost flesh now to the soul is in quality as much a resurrection from the dead, as the addition of the whole body to the soul at the last day; which is to say with the Sadducees [a Jewish sect], there is no resurrection from the dead. … for if the soul live separated from the body, the body cannot be raised from the dead, except the body had a life of its own, differing from that of the soul, and so a man must have two lives (as they say a cat hath nine––the one mortal, the other immortal––and at the Resurrection have two immortalities. If the soul be of a distinct being from the body, and sinned as the body, and thereby incurred the condemnation of Hell, then must the soul have a particular redemption from thence, as the body from the grave, or else it must perish there forever.
