    <p>These materials present resurrections in other registers: from Ovid’s story of the re-assembly of Hippolytus as Virbius, to which Pulter alludes. These materials complement Pulter’s approach to considering the resurrection of the body within Christian theology. Texts gathered here describe  various domestic resurrections promoted and debated in the period in the realms of gardening, cooking, and medicine, as well as a ballad about a bizarre act of Royalist political theatre in 1661.</p>
    <p>Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead.</p>
    <div class="q">
      <ul class="lg">
        <li class="l"><span class="n">1</span> Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary
          and her sister Martha.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">2</span> (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his
          feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">3</span> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom thou
          lovest is sick.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">4</span> When Jesus heard that, he said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for
          the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">5</span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in
          the same place where he was.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">7</span> Then after that saith he to his disciples, “Let us go into Judaea again.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">8</span> His disciples say unto him, “Master, the Jews of late sought to stone
          thee; and goest thou thither again?”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">9</span> Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk
          in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">10</span> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light
          in him.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">11</span> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, “Our friend
          Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">12</span> Then said his disciples, “Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.”</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">13</span> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of
          taking of rest in sleep.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">14</span> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, “Lazarus is dead.</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">15</span> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may
          believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">16</span> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples,
          “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">17</span> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days
          already.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">18</span> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">19</span> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning
          their brother.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">20</span> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met
          him: but Mary sat still in the house.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">21</span> Then said Martha unto Jesus, “Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother
          had not died.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">22</span> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will
          give it thee.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">23</span> Jesus saith unto her, “Thy brother shall rise again.”</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">24</span> Martha saith unto him, “I know that he shall rise again in the
          resurrection at the last day.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">25</span> Jesus said unto her, “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
          believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">26</span> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou
          this?”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">27</span> She saith unto him, “Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the
          Son of God, which should come into the world.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">28</span> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister
          secretly, saying, “The Master is come, and calleth for thee.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">29</span> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">30</span> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where
          Martha met him.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">31</span> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when
          they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, “She goeth unto the grave to weep
          there.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">32</span> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at
          his feet, saying unto him, “Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">33</span> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which
          came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">34</span> And said, “Where have ye laid him?” They said unto him, “Lord, come and
          see.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">35</span> Jesus wept.</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">36</span> Then said the Jews, “Behold how he loved him!”</li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">37</span> And some of them said, “Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the
          blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">38</span> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a
          cave, and a stone lay upon it.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">39</span> Jesus said, “Take ye away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him that was
          dead, saith unto him, “Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">40</span> Jesus saith unto her, “Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
          believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">41</span> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
          And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, “Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">42</span> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which
          stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">43</span> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come
          forth.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">44</span> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes:
          and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, “Loose him, and let him go.”
        </li>
        <li class="l"><span class="n">45</span> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which
          Jesus did, believed on him.

    <p class="title first">Commentary on John 12:24.</p>

    <div class="q">
      <p>
        Observation: After the seed is committed to the earth, it seems to perish and die, as our Savior speaks (John
        12:24): “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone. But if it dies, it brings forth
        much fruit.” The death of the corn in the earth is not a total death, but only the corruption or alteration of
        it: for if once the seminal life and virtue of it were quite extinguished, it could never put forth blade or
        ear without a miracle. Yet, because that alteration is a kind of death, therefore Christ here uses it as a fit
        illustration of the resurrection. And indeed there is nothing in nature more apt to illustrate that great
        mystery. What a fragrant, green and beautiful blade do we see spring up from a corrupted seed? How black, and
        moldy is that? How beautiful and verdant is this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Application: Even thus shall the bodies of the saints arise in beauty and glory at the resurrection. They are
        sown in dishonor; they are raised in glory. They are sown natural bodies; they are raised spiritual bodies (1
        Cor. 15. 43, 44). The husbandman <span class="ign">[or farmer]</span> knows, that though the seed rot in the
        earth, yet it will rise
        again. And the believer knows, that though after his skin worms destroy his body, yet in his flesh he shall
        see God (Job 19. 25, &amp;c.) and the resemblance betwixt the seed sown, and springing up; and the bodies of
        the Saints dying, and rising again, lies in these following particulars.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, the seed is committed to the earth from whence it came, so is the body of a saint; earth it was,
          and to earth it is again resolved. Grace exempts not the body of the best man from seeing corruption (Rom.
          8:10). Though Christ be in him, yet the body is dead; that is, sentenced to death because of sin …
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, the seed is cast into the earth in hope (1 Cor. 9:10). Were there not a resurrection of it
          expected, the husbandman would never be willing to cast away his corn. The bodies of saints are also
          committed to the grave in hope (I Thes. 4:13, 14). But I would not have you to be ignorant brethren,
          concerning those which are asleep, as them which have no hope; for if we believe that Jesus dyed and rose
          again, even so also them which sleep in Jesus shall the Lord bring with him. This blessed hope of a
          resurrection, sweetens, not only the troubles of life, but the pangs of death.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thirdly, the seed is cast into the earth seasonably, in its proper season. So are the bodies of the Saints
          (John 5: 26). Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh in, in its season. They
          always die in the fittest time, though sometimes they seem to die immaturately <span
          class="ign">[too young?]</span>. The time of
          their death was from all eternity pre-fixed by God, beyond which they cannot go, and short of which they
          cannot come.
        </li>
        <li>
          The seed lies many days and nights under the clods, before it rise and appear again. Even so man lieth down,
          and riseth not again till the heavens be no more (Job 14:12). The days of darkness in the grave are many.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the time is come for its shooting up, the earth that covered it can hide it no longer; it cannot keep
          it down a day more. It will find or make a way through the clods. So in that day when the great trump shall
          sound, bone shall come to his bone, and the graves shall not be able to hold them a minute longer. Both sea
          and earth must render the dead that are in them (Rev. 20:13).
        </li>
        <li>
          When the seed appears above ground again, it appears much more fresh and orient <span
          class="ign">[radiant]</span> than when it was
          cast into the earth. God clothes it with such beauty, that it is not like to what it was before. Thus rise
          the bodies of saints, marvelously improved, beautified and perfected with spiritual qualities and rich
          endowments, in respect whereof they are called spiritual bodies (I Cor. 15:43), not properly, but
          analogically spiritual. For look as spirits subsist without food, raiment, sleep; know no lassitude,
          weariness or pain; so our bodies after the resurrection shall be above these necessities and distempers. For
          we shall be as the angels of God (Mat. 22:30). Yea, our vile bodies shall be changed, and made like unto
          Christ’s glorious body, which is the highest pitch, and ascent of glory and honor, that a human body is
          capable of (Phil. 3:21).

      <p>
        For as much as it has pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear
        brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
        dust, in sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
        change our vile body that it may be like to his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is
        able to subdue all things to himself.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        A personage worthy of credit, that had travelled in diverse parts of Asia and Egypt, affirmed to many, that he
        had seen more than once in a certain place near unto Cairo (whether a number of people resort on a certain day
        in the month of March, for to be spectators of the resurrection of the flesh, as they say) of bodies deceased,
        showing and thrusting themselves as it were by little and little out of the ground. Not that they see them
        altogether, but now the hand, then the feet, sometimes half the body, which done, they in like manner hide
        themselves by little and little again in the ground. The rest not giving credit to such a marvel, and I for my
        part desiring to understand the truth of it, inquired of a kinsman and singular friend of mine, a gentleman as
        thoroughly accomplished in all virtues as may be--one that hath been brought up in great honors, and that is
        almost ignorant of nothing. He having traveled in the aforesaid countries with another gentleman, a great and
        familiar friend also of mine, named the Lord Alexander of Schullembourg, told me he had heard of <span
        class="ign">[from]</span> many,
        that this apparition was most certain, and that in Cairo and other places of Egypt, there was no question made
        of it. And the more to assure me, he showed me an Italian book, imprinted at Venice, containing diverse
        descriptions of voyages, made by the ambassadors of Venice into many parts of Asia and Africa, among the which
        one is entitled <span class="it">Viaggio de Messer Aluigi di Giouanni di Alessandria nelle Indie</span>.
        Towards the end whereof I have extracted certain lines translated out of Italian into Latin (and now into
        English) as hereafter follows:

      </p>
      <p>
        “On the 25. of March, in the year 1540, diverse Christians, accompanied with certain janissaries <span
        class="ign">[Ottoman guards]</span>, went from Cairo to a little barren mountain, some half a mile off, designed
        in times past for burial
        of the dead, in the which place every year there usually assembles an incredible multitude of people, for to
        see the dead bodies there interred, as it were issuing out of their graves and sepulchers. This begins on
        Thursday, and continues till Saturday, when they vanish all away. Then may you see bodies wound in their
        sheets, after the ancient manner, but they are not seen standing upright, nor going, but only the arms or
        thighs, or some other part of the body, which you may touch. If you go a little way off, and come by and by
        again, you shall find that those arms, or other members, appear farther out of the ground. And the more you
        change place, the more do those motions appear diverse and greater. At that time, there are a number of
        pavilions pitched about the mountain, for both sick and whole, which repair thither in great troupes <span
        class="ign">[and]</span>
        firmly believe that whosoever washes himself on the Thursday night, with a certain water that runs in a marsh
        hard by, it is a sure remedy to recover and maintain health. But I have not seen that miracle. It is the
        report of the Venetian. Besides the which we have a Jacobin of Ulmes, named Felix, who hath traveled in those
        parts of the Levant, and hath published a Book in Dutch touching all that he hath seen in Palestine and Egypt.
        He makes the very same recital. As I have not undertaken to maintain this apparition to be miraculous, for to
        confound these superstitious idolaters of Egypt, and to show them that there is a resurrection and life to
        come, neither will I refute it, nor maintain it to be a satanical illusion, as many think, but will also leave
        it to the judgement of the reader, for to determine thereof as he shall think good.” (PH. Camerarius,
        Councilor of the Commonwealth of Nuremberg, in the 73. Chap. of his <span
        class="it">Historical Meditations</span>).
      </p>
      <p>
        I will add somewhat hereunto, for the content of the reader: Steven Duplais, a cunning goldsmith, and a man of
        an honest and pleasing conversation, being now some 45 years old, or thereabout, having traveled diverse
        countries of Turkey and Egypt, made me an ample discourse of the apparition before mentioned, some fifteen
        years since, affirming he had been spectator of it with Claude Rocard, an apothecary of Chablis in Champagne,
        and twelve other Christians, having for their truckman and guide a goldsmith of Ottranto in Apulia, called
        Alexander Maniotti.
      </p>
      <p>
        He told me, moreover, that he (as the rest) had touched diverse members of those ressustitants <span
        class="ign">[resuscitated or resurrected persons]</span>. And as he was taking hold on the hair of a child’s
        head, a man of Cairo cried out,
        “Kali, Kali, antè matarasdè,” that is to say, “let it alone, let it alone, thou knowest not what thou dost.”
        Now forasmuch as I could not well persuade myself that there was any such matter as he told me of--though in
        diverse other reports conferred with that which is to be read in our modern authors, I had always found him
        simple and true--we continued a long time in this opposition of my ears to his eyes, until the year 1591, that
        having showed him the above-said observations of Doctor Camerarius: “Now you may see” (said he) “that I have
        told you no fables.” And many times since, we have talked of it with wonder and reverence of the divine
        wisdom. Furthermore, he told me thereupon that a Christian dwelling in Egypt had diverse times recounted unto
        him, upon talk of this apparition or resurrection, that he had learned of his grandfather and father, which
        their ancestors had reported, having received it from hand to hand time out of mind, that certain hundred
        years ago, divers Christians, men, women, and children, being assembled in that mountain, for to do some
        exercise of their religion, were environed <span class="ign">[surrounded]</span> and compassed about by a great
        number of their
        enemies, the little mountains being but of a small circuit, who cut them all in pieces, and having covered
        their bodies with earth, returned to Cairo. Ever since the which, this resurrection hath appeared the space of
        certain days before and after that of the massacre. Behold a summary of Steven Duplais’ discourse, by him
        confirmed and renewed in the end of April 1600, when I wrote this History, whereunto that can be nothing
        prejudicial, which is recited by Martin Baumgarten in his voyage to Egypt, made the year 1507, published by
        his successors, and imprinted at Nuremberg, in the year 1594. For in the eighteenth chapter of the first book,
        he says that these apparitions are made in a mosque of the Turks hard by Cairo. There is a fault in the copy:
        and it should say hillock or little mountain, not on the bank of Nilus, as Baumgarten writes, but half a mile
        off, as we have declared.

        <li class="l">Perhaps you’ve heard of one Hippolytus,</li>
        <li class="l">By step dame’s fraud, and father’s credulous</li>
        <li class="l">Belief bequeathed to death. Admire you may</li>
        <li class="l">That I am he, if credit what I say,</li>
        <li class="l">Whom Phaedra formerly solicited,</li>
        <li class="l">But vainly, to defile my father’s bed.</li>
        <li class="l">Fearing detection, or in that refused,</li>
        <li class="l">She turns the crime, and me of her's accused.</li>
        <li class="l">My father, banishing the innocent,</li>
        <li class="l">Along with me his winged curses sent.</li>
        <li class="l">Toward Pitthean Troezen* me my chariot bore,
          <div class="sidenote">*the land of Troezen, once ruled by Pittheus</div>
        </li>
        <li class="l">And driving now by the <span class="it">Corinthian</span> shore,</li>
        <li class="l">The smooth seas swell; a monstrous billow rose,</li>
        <li class="l">Which, roiling like a mountain,* greater grows,
          <div class="sidenote">*surging up as high as a mountain</div>
        </li>
        <li class="l">Then, bellowing, at the top asunder rends.</li>

        <li class="l">Who at his dreadful mouth and nostrils spouts</li>
        <li class="l">Part of the sea. Fear all my followers routs.*
          <div class="sidenote">*drives away</div>
        </li>
        <li class="l">But my afflicted mind was all this while</li>
        <li class="l">Unterrified, intending my exile.</li>
        <li class="l">When the hot horses start, erect their ears,</li>
        <li class="l">With horror rapt, and chased by their fears,</li>
        <li class="l">Ore ragged rocks the tattered chariot drew.
        </li>
        <li class="l">In vain I strive their fury to subdue,
        </li>
        <li class="l">The bits all frothed with foam, with all my strength</li>
        <li class="l">Pull the stretched reins; I lying at full length.</li>
        <li class="l">Nor had their heady fright my strength o'r-gone,</li>
        <li class="l">Had not the fervent wheel, which rolls upon</li>
        <li class="l">The bearing axel-tree, rushed on a stump,
        </li>
        <li class="l">Which brake, and fell asunder with that jump.</li>
        <li class="l">Thrown from my chariot, in the reins fast-bound,</li>
        <li class="l">My guts dragged out alive; my sinews wound</li>
        <li class="l">About the stump; my limbs in pieces haled,*
          <div class="sidenote">*pulled</div>
        </li>
        <li class="l">Some stuck behind, some at the chariot trailed.</li>
        <li class="l">My bones then breaking cracked, not any whole,</li>
        <li class="l">While I exhaled my faint and weary soul.</li>
        <li class="l">No part of all my parts you could have found</li>
        <li class="l">That might be known, for all was but one wound.</li>

        <li class="l">You your calamities with ours compare?</li>
        <li class="l">I also saw those realms, today unknown,</li>
        <li class="l">And bathed my wounds in smoking Phlegethon.*

        <li class="l">Of his great art, I with the dead had stayed.</li>

          <div class="sidenote">*Greek god of healing</div>
        </li>
        <li class="l">I was restored, against stern Pluto’s will.</li>
        <li class="l">Least I, if seen, might envy have procured,</li>

        <li class="l">Whether in Delos, doubting, or in Crete,</li>
        <li class="l">Rejecting Crete and Delos as unmeet,</li>
        <li class="l">She placed me here. Nor would I should retain</li>

        <li class="l">One of the lesser gods, here, in this grove</li>
