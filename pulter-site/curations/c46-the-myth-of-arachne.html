    <p>In the first line of the poem Pulter mentions <span class="it">Arachne</span> or the spider. The spiderâ€™s link with the traditionally feminine arts of sewing and weaving makes it an interesting image of female creativity, though the myth, as retold in a contemporary natural history, makes it a story about the dangers of female pride.

      <p>The Poets fayne that the Spyder called <span class="it">Arachne</span>, was in times past a mayden of <span class="it">Lydia</span>, who beeing instructed of <span class="it">Minerua</span> in the cunning skill of Embroiderie and spynning, grew therein so excellent, and tooke such a pride in the same, (for you must remember she was a woman) that shee stifly denied, facing it out in brauing-wise, that <span class="it">Minerua</span> was neuer the Instructer, and so arrogant presumpteous shee was, as that she feared not to challenge her Mistresse-Goddesse to worke with her, if shee durst for her eares enter the lyst, in all manner of Embroidery, Tapestry-workes, and the like.</p>
      <p>At which, Mistres <span class="it">Minerua</span> beeing netled, and taking the matter in dudgeon thus to be prouoked, and withall reprehending the mayde very sharply for her sauciness, in a pelting chase she brake all to peeces the wenches imagery worke, that was so curiously wouen, & so full of varietie, with her shittle [i.e., shuttle, an instrument used in weaving]. The Mayde heereat beeing sore greeued, halfe in despayre not knowing what to doe, yeelding to passion, would needes hang herselfe. But <span class="it">Minerua</span> taking compassion vppon her, would not haue her die forth-with, but transformed her into a Spyder, hanging by a fine small thred or line.</p>
