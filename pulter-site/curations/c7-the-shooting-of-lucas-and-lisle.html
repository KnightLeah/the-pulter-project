      “Is Lucas and Lisle slain?” the speaker asks at the start of “On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester” (Poem 7). The two royalist commanders, Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, were indeed arrested and executed at Colchester on August 28, 1648. You will find here texts variously describing, justifying, and lamenting the executions. A short narrative of the event appears in the headnote for the Amplified Edition of the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document includes both Lucas’s final speech and two speeches countering him, one by C. R., one of the Lord General’s (Thomas Fairfax’s) officers, and one by “a private soldier” reminding readers of the Lord General’s authority and of Lucas’s own war crimes. Lucas here laments that he was not tried before “indifferent Judges” and was executed rather than shown mercy even though he surrendered “by Treaty, upon terms of Mercy.”  He asks to be interred in the family vault.

        As for my body, I do desire you that it may be decently carried to my own house, and that my friends may have liberty to inter it with my ancestors, and set it in the vault of the Church where they were laid before me; And in the interim, that there may be no incivility offered to my body here, when I am dead, and that my corpse may remain quiet without molestation when it is carried away.

      <p>
        For the Right Honorable Edward Earl of Manchester, Speaker of the House of Peers Pro Tempore (dated August 29, 1648, the day after the shooting). My Lord: I have herewith sent you the Articles, with the Explanations annexed, upon which it hath pleased God in his best time to deliver the Town of Colchester, and the enemy therein into your hands without further bloodshed, saving that (for some satisfaction to Military Justice, and in part of avenge for the innocent blood they have caused to be spilt, and the trouble, damage, and mischief they have brought upon the Town, this Country, and the Kingdom) I have with the advice of a council of war of the chief officers both of country forces and the Army, caused two of them who were rendered at mercy to be shot to death before any of them had Quarter assured them. The persons pitched upon for the example were, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Lisle, in whose military execution I hope your lordships will not find cause to think your honor or justice prejudiced.

        The same day examples of Justice was done upon Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Lyle, the former was conceived (and too true) to be the cause of the ruin of this place, his interest in the Town drawing the Army thither. He was the head of all those that did rise in this County, and so brought the odium of the country upon him, and at last grew harsh to the townspeople, (a thing contrary to his wonted disposition) when they complained for want of bread, not regarding what misery he brought upon that place where he was born; besides, it was affirmed unto him by four persons at his death, that he put two men to the sword with his own hands in cold blood, long after quarter granted. The other, as was informed, was a great cause of burning of the houses about the town, and a person bent to much mischief.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first example of Justice that ever was showed in this kind (since the first and second war) by the Parliament’s party, though it be according to the rule of war (in submitting to mercy).  The example hereof was given by the King’s party in the west, when fourteen country men, that among others submitted to mercy, were all hanged up together.

    <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
    <p>
      Colonel Thomas Rainsborough, present at the execution, was himself murdered in his bed-chamber just a few months later. Royalists celebrated this as a just comeuppance. Parliamentarians heroized him and decried his killers. See “A New Elegie In Memory of the Right Valiant, and Most Renowned Souldier, Col. Rainsborough, late Admiral of the narrow Seas” (London, 1648.

        About seven at night Sir Charles Lucas was brought forth, tied to a pillar, and shot to death, his color not the least changing, or any sign of fear approaching either by his words or gesture; his blessed soul being thus dismissed to his maker, Sir George Lisle was next brought forth, who after he had kissed the pale lips of his dead friend, valiant Sir Charles, and made a short but pithy prayer, offered himself to death with such willingness that the bloody damned ‘Saints’ were astonished at his courage, which surpassed any ancient Roman we read of, but a pistol put to his ear and discharged, he soon became exanimated earth. … and so those two worthy Knights were massacred for their Loyalty to their King, and love to their country, over whose graves (for I hope the devilish Saints will not deny them sepulture) give me leave to weep this Elegy.

        Sir George Lisle’s turn was next, who beholding that sad spectacle, the dead body of his dearest friend, fell upon it and kissed it, as if he meant to breath into it another soul. Not a passionate express, but bedewed with a funeral tear, with a free, true relation of his virtues and endowments, of which this ungrateful nation was not worthy. Often would he redouble these words: ‘In how short a moment has a brave spirit expired! Well, this priority was due to thee, but I shall not be long behind thee. My death which is now at hand, shall restore thee to me. This, with assured hopes I have in Him that made me, shall make my translation cheerful. My divorce from such a friend enjoins me to hasten to him.’ …
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet observe one passage more, and you shall see with what impunity these merciless times can dispense with the inhumanest actions. Not to hold you in suspense, it was thus. The body of that noble and ever memorable Knight, Sir Charles, being to be buried with his Ancestors, a civil courtesy which he much desired before his death, and entered the vault where his predecessors had been usually interred, some of those insolent and inhumane soldiers, upon opening of the monument, wherein diverse bodies lay wrapt in lead, intending, it seems, to discover their barbarism in the highest measure, forebore not only to cut away the lead wherein those bodies were enfolded, but to pull off the very hair (O matchless impiety!) which grew upon their scalps; whereof diverse among them, made them hatbands and bracelets, which they no less contemptibly then disgracefully wore, glorying, as it seems, in their pillage of those native remains and ornaments of the dead. This they did in a despite and grounded hate to his family, after such time as they had acted their cruel tragedy. O inexemplary fury! If such brutish spirits be not timely subdued, England will lose both name and nature, and become Barbarians. If the memorials of the dead, those last houses, their urns, many not be secured from violence, what safety may civil societies presume to have?

      Cavendish added this second poem about her brother’s execution when she revised and expanded her <span class="it">Poems and Fancies</span> for a second edition in 1664. This later poem is in Charles Lucas’s voice. It precedes the earlier poem, retitled in this 1664 edition “An Elegy upon the Death of My Brother.”
