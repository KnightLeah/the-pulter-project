      Pulter writes of being dispersed into atoms upon her death in her six-line coda to “Why Must I Thus Forever Be
      Confined” (Poem 57). These atoms would surround the universe, be buffeted by other atoms, and then reform to
      constitute another world. Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, also speculated on the existence of other
      worlds. In “Of many Worlds in this World,” Cavendish imagines that there may be tiny worlds within our own world,
      perhaps in an earring or a pin. Her suggestion that ladies may wear worlds in their ears turns an image of
      feminine adornment into one of scientific potential, depicting tiny planets under the control of a beneficent,
      goddess-like figure.
