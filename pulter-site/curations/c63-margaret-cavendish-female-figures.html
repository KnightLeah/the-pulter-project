    <p>In line 17, the speaker mentions what will happen to her body after her death. Ultimately every particle of dust will be safe because of God’s justice, even though it might be tossed in a thousand figures or shapes. “Figures” is a term used to characterize the movement of atoms at this time. Margaret Cavendish offers a playfully gendered perspective in the poem “Motion makes Atomes a Bawd for Figure.” She personifies motion as male, and atoms and forms as female. Motion, who is wild, persuaded atoms to be his bawds (or procurers of prostitutes) in order to create a variety of young female forms or figures to delight him. Because motion likes variety, young forms are constantly replacing the old.</p>
