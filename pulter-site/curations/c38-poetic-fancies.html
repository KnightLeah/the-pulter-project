    <p>In lines 4 and 8, Pulter refers to her inventions or imaginings as “fancies.” The word “fancy” was synonymous with “imagination” at this time (<span class="it">OED</span> 4) but in addition to referring to a process, it could also refer to the inventions or products of imagination. Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, gave her first collection of poetry the title <span class="it">Poems, and fancies</span>, and in the extract below she celebrates the power of poetic creativity by personifying Fancy as painlessly emerging from a poet’s brain.</p>
