        <li class="l t-4">The prophetess did cast</li>
        <li class="l">Her eye upon Aeneas’ back, and sighing said at last:</li>
        <li class="l">I am no goddess. Neither think thou canst with conscience right,</li>
        <li class="l">With holy incense honor give to any mortal wight.</li>
        <li class="l">But to th’intent through ignorance thou err not. I had been</li>
        <li class="l">Eternal and of worldly life; I should none end have seen,</li>
        <li class="l">If that I would my maidenhood on Phoebus have bestowed.</li>
        <li class="l">Howbeit while he stood in hope to have the same, and trowed* <div class="sidenote">*trusted, was confident</div></li>
        <li class="l">To overcome me with his gifts: ‘Thou maid of Cumes’ (quoth he)</li>
        <li class="l">‘Choose what thou wilt, and of thy wish the owner thou shalt bee.’</li>
        <li class="l">I taking full my hand of dust, and showing it him there,</li>
        <li class="l">Desired like a fool to live as many years as were</li>
        <li class="l">Small grains of cinder in that heap. I quite forgot to crave</li>
        <li class="l">Immediately the race of all those years in youth to have.</li>
        <li class="l">Yet did he grant me also that, upon condition I</li>
        <li class="l">Would let him have my maidenhood, which thing I did deny.</li>
        <li class="l">And so rejecting Phoebus’ gift, a single life I led.</li>
        <li class="l">But now the blissful time of youth is altogether fled,</li>
        <li class="l">And irksome age with trembling pace is stolen upon my head,</li>
        <li class="l">Which long I must endure. For now already as you see</li>
        <li class="l">Seven hundred years are come and gone and that the number be</li>
        <li class="l">Full matched of the grains of dust, three hundred harvests mo,</li>
        <li class="l">I must three hundred vintages see more before I go.</li>
        <li class="l">The day will come that length of time shall make my body small,</li>
        <li class="l">And little of my withered limbs shall leave or naught at all.</li>
        <li class="l">And none shall think that ever God was ta’en in love with me.</li>
        <li class="l">Even out of Phoebus’ knowledge then perchance I grown shall bee,</li>
        <li class="l">Or at the least that ever he me loved he shall deny,</li>
        <li class="l">So sore I shall be altered. And then shall no man’s eye</li>
        <li class="l">Discern me. Only by my voice I shall be known. For why?</li>
        <li class="l">The fates shall leave me still my voice for folk to know me by. </li>
