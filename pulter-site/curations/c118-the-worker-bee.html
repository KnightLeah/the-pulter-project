                <p>The worker bee was not accustomed to serving, like her drone brother, as a cautionary tale. After all, she was thoroughly ensconced in a literary tradition that framed her as an exemplar of industry and virtue. In <a href="/poems/118" title="Read “The Snail, the Tulip, and the Bee” (Emblem 53)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Snail, the Tulip, and the Bee</span><span class="idx">118</span></a>, Pulter imagines a solitary bee independent of her hive starting her day in the garden as an “active Amazonian maid” and ending it with a futile and self-imposed trial that will precipitate her untimely death (7). In Pulter’s depiction, this bee offers a warning to those who would “struggle against their destiny” (38). Given the frequency of the garden setting in Pulter’s poems (see Whitney Sperrazza’s Curation, <ref target="#ctxs" type="pp-curations-ref">Pulter’s Garden</ref>), it is perhaps unsurprising that bug life features so prominently in her verse, including images of bees in <a href="/poems/34" title="Read “To Aurora [3]” (Poem 34)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">To Aurora [3]</span><span class="idx">34</span></a> and <a href="/poems/57" title="Read “Why Must I Thus Be Forever Confined” (Poem 57)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Why Must I Thus Be Forever Confined</span><span class="idx">57</span></a>; spiders in “The Snail, the Tulip, and the Bee” (Emblem 53), <a href="/poems/102" title="Read “The Ugly Spider” (Poem 102)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Ugly Spider</span><span class="idx">102</span></a>, and <a href="/poems/88" title="Read “The Toad and the Spider” (Emblem 23)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Toad and the Spider</span><span class="idx">88</span></a>; and ants in <a href="/poems/35" title="Read “The Pismire” (Poem 35)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Pismire</span><span class="idx">35</span></a>. In Emblem 53, Pulter engages with the apian tradition while also offering an inventive reconsideration of honeybee self-sacrifice.</p>
                <p>The viewpoint of the beehive as a model for the ideal government of human societies is well established within the literary tradition. The image of the well governed and orderly hive is popularized in Book 4 of Virgil’s <span class="it">Georgics</span>:</p>

                <p>In early modern England, many writers and beekeepers sought to expand the understanding of apian virtue, holding up hive culture as exemplary in chastity, order, obedience, cleanliness, discernment, and self-sacrifice. Shakespeare’s Archbishop of Canterbury, in his effort to convince Henry V to wage battle in France while simultaneously directing English troops to defend against Scottish incursion, marshals the beehive as representative of human social structures:</p>

            Whereas the classic tradition styled the sovereign bee as a king, the seventeenth century witnessed the growing consensus and eventual confirmation that she was a queen. In the preface to <span class="it">The Feminine Monarchie</span>, Charles Butler indicates that he will translate all references of “Rex” in ancient texts to “Queene, sith the males heer beare no sway at al[l], this being an Amazonian or feminine kingdom” (Charles Butler, <span class="it">The Feminine Monarchie</span> [Oxford, 1609], n.p., emphasis in original). Butler’s influential work is largely responsible for popularizing the understanding that queens and worker bees are female and drones male. Moreover, from 1669 to 1673, Jan Swammerdam confirmed these findings through microscopic examination. Pulter’s depiction of the worker bee as “the active Amazonian maid” thus demonstrates contemporary knowledge of bee sex and social structure (7).   
        </p>
        <p>
            Honeybee physiology offers only a glimpse into Pulter’s substantial engagement with natural history. As many scholars observe, Pulter’s verse demonstrates her understanding of alchemy, astronomy, and physics (see, for instance, Liza Blake, “Hester Pulter’s Particle Physics and the Poetics of Involution,” <span class="it">Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies</span> 20, no. 2 [Spring 2020]: 71-98. See also Nicole A. Jacobs, “Worker Bee Sacrifice,” in <span class="it">Bees in Early Modern Transatlantic Literature: Sovereign Colony</span> [Routledge, New York, 2021], 131-58). Pulter’s emblems on animals, plants, and alchemical processes bridge the divide between scientific knowledge and literary representation, highlighting both the physical and symbolic importance of non-human life.

            Francis Bacon’s <span class="it">Novum Organum</span> (1620) frames scientific enterprise through insect and arachnid metaphors. In his representation, researchers may follow three potential symbolic pathways: the ant, the spider, or the bee. Bacon rejects the straightforward empiricism of those practitioners who act as collector ants or the dogmatism of those who emulate the crafty spider. To Bacon, the female worker bee offers a middle way to scientists who explore the raw material available and craft a well reasoned interpretive framework:

            <span class="bt">Francis Bacon</span>, <span class="it">Novum Organum</span>
        <p>Those who have treated of the sciences have been either empirics or dogmatic. The former like ants only heap up and use their store, the latter like spiders spin out their own webs. The bee, a mean between both, extracts matter from the flowers of the garden and the field, but works and fashions it by its own efforts. The true labor of philosophy resembles hers, for it neither relies entirely or principally on the powers of the mind, not yet lays up in the memory the matter afforded by the experiments of natural history and mechanics in its raw state, but changes and works it in the understanding.

                    The notion that a bee, unlike a drone, would work itself to death is well established in the early modern period. However, Pulter’s depiction of this worker as “covetous” (22), a negative character trait, is decidedly less common. Andrew Marvel’s <span class="it">Upon Appleton House</span> (c. 1651-3) also includes a bee that spends a night in a tulip. Karen Britland makes a case for the possibility that Pulter and Marvell were aware of one another’s work (Karen Britland, “Conspiring with ‘friends’: Hester Pulter’s Poetry and the Stanley Family at Cumberlow Green,” <span class="it">The Review of English Studies</span> 69, no. 292 [2018]: 832-54). Unlike Pulter’s worker, however, Marvell’s bee is a soldier ordered to stand guard:

                   John Evelyn, John Thorley, and several other beekeepers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries address the knowledge and prevalence of women beekeepers. By the nineteenth century, there were some efforts to make beekeeping more accessible among genteel and aristocratic ladies, especially given the heavy labor required for using bee boxes instead of straw skeps. Whereas skeps required the beekeeper to kill the bees in order to harvest the honey and wax, the stacked box design allowed him or her to collect hive materials while preserving the bees. Samuel Bagster’s <span class="it">The Management of Bees with a Description of the “Ladies Safety Hive”</span> (1834) introduces the innovative apiary designs of Madame Vicat, which allowed the keeper to lift more easily individual boxes that were lined up sequentially rather than stacked:

                 <p>Mad[ame] Vicat, a native of Switzerland, has contributed very largely to the knowledge of the natural history of the bee, and having observed great inconvenience attending the use of boxes or hives, which are placed on one another, she contrived a hive formed of collateral boxes. ... This hive is composed of its four [parallel] boxes, screwed fast together.

                         Rusden’s <span class="it">A Further Discovery of Bees</span> depicts a hexagonal box design that would allow beekeepers to harvest honey and wax while preserving their hive.
