                <p>Many incarnations of a strange tale of a whale hunt seem to have originated from a Spanish explorer in the late sixteenth century; Pulter’s “This Huge Leviathan” (Emblem 42) is one of them. The whaling story appears in José de Acosta’s <span class="it">The Natural and Moral History of the East and West Indies</span>, published in 1590 and translated into English in 1604. Acosta was a Jesuit missionary and philosopher who traveled to Panama, Peru, and Mexico. But he never voyaged to Florida; his description of this whale hunt is based on the report of “some expert men.”<span class="lato place-above fn-num">1</span> Acosta characterizes American “Indians” simultaneously as evidence of God’s might, “wherein appears the power and greatness of the Creator,” and as “so base a nation,” firmly asserting the inferiority of their race to his own. He effectively erases their tribal identity from the story by referring to them only as “Indians.” A postcolonial reading of the text may emphasize parallels between the struggle of the hunter and the whale and the colonizer and the colonized. The term “conqueror,” for example, used to describe the hunter, evokes the conquistadors who subjugated Indigenous peoples all over the world to Spanish rule. Eardley notes that Pulter may have read the tale in Samuel Purchas’s <span class="it">Hakluytus Posthumus, or, Purchas his Pilgrims</span> (1625), which features Acosta’s version of the story.<span class="lato place-above fn-num">2</span> Purchas was a clergyman and never travelled outside of England; he was a compiler of travel stories related to him by explorers and sailors.</p>

                    But the combat which the Indians have with whales is yet more admirable, wherein appears the power and greatness of the Creator, to give so base a nation (as be the Indians) the industry and courage to encounter the most fierce and deformed beast in the world, and [not] only to fight with him, but also to vanquish him, and to triumph over him.<span class="lato place-above fn-num">1</span> Considering this, I have often remembered that place of the Psalm, speaking of the whale, <span class="it">Draco iste quem formasti ad illudendum eum</span><span class="lato place-above fn-num">2</span>: What greater mockery can there be, than to see an Indian lead a whale as big as a mountain, vanquished with a cord? The manner the Indians of Florida use (as some expert men have told me) to take these whales, (whereof there is great store) is, they put themselves into a canoe, which is like a bark of a tree, and in swimming approach near the whale’s side, then with great dexterity they leap to his neck, and there they ride as on horseback expecting his time, then he thrusts a sharp and strong stake (which he carries with him) into the whale’s nostril, for so they call the hole or vent by which they breathe, presently he beats it in with another stake as forcibly as he can; in the mean space the whale doth furiously beat the sea, and raiseth mountains of water, running into the deep with great violence, and presently riseth again, not knowing what to do for pain; the Indian still sits firm, and to give him full payment for this trouble, he beats another stake into the other vent or nostril, so as he stoppeth him quite, and takes away his breathing, then he betakes him to his canoe, which he holds tied with a cord to the whale’s side, and goes to land, having first tied his cord to the whale, the which he lets run with the whale, who leaps from place to place, whilst he finds water enough: being troubled with pain, in the end he comes near the land, and remains on ground by the hugeness of his body, unable any more to move; then a great number of Indians come unto the conqueror, to gather his spoils, they kill him, and cut his flesh in pieces<span class="lato place-above fn-num">3</span>, the which is bad enough; this do they dry and beat into powder, using it for meat, it doth last them long: wherein is fulfilled, that which is spoken in another psalm of the whale, <span class="it">Dedisti eum escam populis Aethiopum.</span><span class="lato place-above fn-num">4</span>

In this sentence, the “conqueror” refers to the triumphant hunter whose spoils the “Indians” share in, but the “him” in the next part of the sentence, “they kill him, and cut his flesh in pieces,” refers to the whale.</p>

                <p>One of these expert men may have been Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda. The son of a Spanish officer, he was born in Colombia or Peru around 1536. At the age of thirteen he boarded a ship bound for Spain and survived a shipwreck, arriving on the coast of Florida. He was captured by the Calusa and lived among them and other Indigenous tribes in Florida for seventeen years. He was rescued around 1566 by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, the Spanish governor of Florida from 1565 to 1574. Fontaneda returned to Spain in 1569 and wrote his memoir, an account of his time in Florida addressed to the king of Spain, by 1575. An account of a whale hunt is featured in an extant manuscript written in Fontaneda’s hand. It is possible that he intended to include it in his memoir but later decided against it.<span class="lato place-above fn-num">3</span> It is similar to Acosta’s story, albeit much briefer. The date of Fontaneda’s death is unknown. Acosta returned to Spain from his own travels in 1587, so it is possible that he heard the story of the whale hunt from Fontaneda or had access to his manuscript. According to Fontaneda, this manner of whaling was a ritual of the Tequesta, a tribe that inhabited the southeast Atlantic coast of Florida.

                    [I]n the winter all the canoes come forth to the sea. Among all these Indians one Indian is sent forth who carries three stakes in his belt, and he throws the lasso around the neck, and while the whale is diving he inserts a stake through one nostril, and thus as it is tied he does not lose it, because he goes on it, and in killing it as he kills it they pull it until it runs aground in the sand.

                    <p>1. The tribe is also known as the Tequesta, Tekesta, or Chequesta. “Los Martires” or “the Martyrs” are a group of islands south of Florida named by Spanish conquistador Ponce de León, now called the Florida Keys. “Cañaveral” refers to Cape Canaveral, which lies farther north on the Atlantic coast of Florida.</p>
                </div>

                <p>According to Fontaneda, the whale hunt held a spiritual importance for the Tequesta as a part of the funeral rites for a chief. He describes the hunt as a prelude to a wake: the major bones of the chief are placed in a chest and publicly displayed in the house of the chief for the community to visit, and then the hunters “open the head [of the whale] and remove two bones . . . and these two bones they put in this chest in which they place the dead, and they adore this.”<span class="lato place-above fn-num">4</span></p>
                <p>Pulter was not the first to versify this whaling legend: Friar Alonso Gregorio de Escobedo includes a similar story in his epic poem “La Florida” (c. 1598–1615).<span class="lato place-above fn-num">5</span> Escobedo was a missionary who voyaged to America to convert its Indigenous inhabitants to Catholicism and wrote this epic on his return to Spain. Like Acosta, he insists on the reliability of his sources. His poetical account matches the other versions of the story, although curiously, the hunters of his poem drive stakes into the whale’s ears rather than its nostrils.</p>
