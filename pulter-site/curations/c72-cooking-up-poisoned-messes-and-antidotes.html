  Just as mountebanks were not always easy to distinguish from physicians or orators, so cooking and preparing medicines were interrelated.  The young mountebank’s preparation of a “fulsome dish” with a sauce is not that different from other kinds of cooking; in turn, cookbooks might include recipes for antidotes.

      The aim of this book is to show how empirical categories–such as the categories of the raw and the cooked, the fresh and the decayed, the moistened and the burned, etc., which can only be accurately defined by ethnographic observation and, in each instance, by adopting the standpoint of a particular culture–can nonetheless be used as conceptual tools with which to elaborate abstract ideas and combine them in the form of propositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raw/cooked axis is characteristic of culture; the fresh/decayed one of nature, since cooking brings about the cultural transformation of the raw, just as putrefaction is its natural transformation.
