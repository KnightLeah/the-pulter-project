      Pulter’s emblem works to demonstrate the restless and emotive public opinion surrounding the events of the Civil War, and particularly the execution itself. Her description of the “sad spectators” gives them a restless and mob-like appearance which becomes more fervent throughout her account of the duel (line 5). The focus on their reactions to the duel gives them a sense of immediacy, reflecting the spectatorial role citizens had at King Charles I’s execution. A German woodcarving published in 1649 is a useful visual representation for what Pulter depicts verbally in her emblem, as the image captures the civil unrest brewing amongst the spectators at Charles’s beheading.
