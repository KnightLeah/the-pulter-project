      Pulter’s description of Jane as a hunted deer is echoed in several contemporary poems. In the first edition of “Cooper’s Hill” (1642), John Denham begins by describing a specific landscape, that of Cooper’s Hill at his family estate in Surrey. He then ruminates on English politics from the perspective of a Royalist at the beginning of a civil war. The following poem is an excerpt from the first edition of “Cooper’s Hill,” line 263 to end.

        <li class="l">Here have I seen our Charles, when great affairs</li>
        <li class="l">Give leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,</li>
        <li class="l">Chasing the royal Stag, the gallant beast,</li>
        <li class="l">Roused with the noise ‘twixt hope and fear distressed,</li>
        <li class="l">Resolves ‘tis better to avoid, then meet</li>
        <li class="l">His danger, trusting to his winged feet:</li>
        <li class="l">But when he sees the dogs, now by the view</li>
        <li class="l">Now by the scent his speed with speed pursue,</li>
        <li class="l">He tries his friends, amongst the lesser Herd,</li>
        <li class="l">Where he but lately was obeyed, and feared,</li>
        <li class="l">Safety he seeks, the herd unkindly wise,</li>
        <li class="l">Or chases him from thence, or from him flies,</li>
        <li class="l">Like a declining Statesman, left forlorn</li>
        <li class="l">To his friends’ pity, and pursuers’ scorn.</li>
        <li class="l">Wearied, forsaken, and pursued at last</li>
        <li class="l">All safety in despair of safety placed.</li>
        <li class="l">Courage he thence assumes, resolved to bear</li>
        <li class="l">All their assaults, since ‘tis in vain to fear,</li>
        <li class="l">But when he sees the eager chase renewed</li>
        <li class="l">Himself by dogs, the dogs by men pursued.</li>
        <li class="l">When neither speed, nor art, nor friends, nor force</li>
        <li class="l">Could help him towards the stream he bends his course.</li>
        <li class="l">Hoping those lesser beasts would not assay</li>
        <li class="l">An element, more merciless than they.</li>
        <li class="l">But fearless they pursue, nor can the flood</li>
        <li class="l">Quench their dire thirst (alas) they thirst for blood:</li>
        <li class="l">As some brave Hero, whom his baser foes</li>
        <li class="l">In troops surround, now these assail, now those</li>
        <li class="l">Though prodigal of life, disdains to die</li>
        <li class="l">By vulgar hands, but if he can descry</li>
        <li class="l">Some Nobler foes approach, to him he calls</li>
        <li class="l">And begs his fate, and then contented falls:</li>
        <li class="l">So the tall Stag, amidst the lesser hounds</li>
        <li class="l">Repels their force, and wounds return for wounds,</li>
        <li class="l">Till Charles from his unerring hand lets fly</li>
        <li class="l">A mortal shaft, then glad, and proud to die</li>
        <li class="l">By such a Wound he falls, the Crystal flood</li>
        <li class="l">Dying he dies, and purples with his blood:</li>
        <li class="l">This a more Innocent, and happy chase</li>
        <li class="l">Than when of old, but in the self-same place,</li>
        <li class="l">Fair liberty pursued, and meant a Prey</li>
        <li class="l">To tyranny, here turned, and stood at bay.</li>
        <li class="l">When in that remedy all hope was placed</li>
        <li class="l">Which was, or should have been at least the last.</li>
        <li class="l">For armed subjects can have no pretense</li>
        <li class="l">Against their Princes, but their just defense,</li>
        <li class="l">And whether then, or no, I leave to them</li>
        <li class="l">To justify, who else themselves condemn:</li>
        <li class="l">Yet might the fact be just, if we may guess</li>
        <li class="l">The justness of an action from success</li>
        <li class="l">Here was that Charter sealed, wherein the Crown</li>
        <li class="l">All marks of Arbitrary power lays down:</li>
        <li class="l">Tyrant and Slave, those names of hate and fear,</li>
        <li class="l">The happier style of King and Subject bear:</li>
        <li class="l">Happy when both to the same Center move,</li>
        <li class="l">When Kings give liberty, and Subjects love.</li>
        <li class="l">Therefore not long in force this Charter stood</li>
        <li class="l">Wanting that seal, it must be sealed in blood.</li>
        <li class="l">The Subjects armed, the more their Princes gave,</li>
        <li class="l">But this advantage took, the more to crave:</li>
        <li class="l">Till Kings by giving, give themselves away.</li>
        <li class="l">And even that power, that should deny, betray,</li>
        <li class="l">“Who gives constrained, but his own fear reviles</li>
        <li class="l">Not thanked, but scorned, nor are they gifts, but spoils.”</li>
        <li class="l">And they, whom no denial can withstand,</li>
        <li class="l">Seem but to ask, while they indeed command.</li>
        <li class="l">Thus all to limit Royalty conspire,</li>
        <li class="l">While each forgets to limit his desire.</li>
        <li class="l">Till Kings like old Antaeus by their fall,</li>
        <li class="l">Being forced, their courage from despair recall.</li>
        <li class="l">When a calm River raised with sudden rains,</li>
        <li class="l">Or Snows dissolved o’erflows th’ adjoining Plains</li>
        <li class="l">The Husbandmen with high raised banks secure</li>
        <li class="l">Their greedy hopes, and this he can endure,</li>
        <li class="l">But if with Bogs, and Dams they strive to force,</li>
        <li class="l">His channel to a new, or narrow course,</li>
        <li class="l">No longer then within his banks he dwells,</li>
        <li class="l">First to a Torrent, then a Deluge swells</li>
        <li class="l">Stronger, and fiercer by restraint he roars,</li>
        <li class="l">And knows no bound, but makes his powers his shores:</li>
        <li class="l">Thus Kings by grasping more than they can hold,</li>
        <li class="l">First made their Subjects by oppressions bold,</li>
        <li class="l">And popular sway by forcing Kings to give</li>
        <li class="l">More, than was fit for Subjects to receive,</li>
        <li class="l">Ran to the same extreme, and one excess</li>
        <li class="l">Made both by stirring to be greater, less.</li>
        <li class="l">Nor any way, but seeking to have more</li>
        <li class="l">Makes either lose, what each possessed before.</li>
        <li class="l">Therefore their boundless power tell Princes draw</li>
        <li class="l">Within the Channel, and the shores of Law,</li>
        <li class="l">And may that Law, which teaches Kings to sway</li>
        <li class="l">Their Scepters, teach their Subjects to obey.</li>

        <li class="l">Ungentle men! they cannot thrive</li>
        <li class="l">To kill thee. Thou ne’er didst alive</li>

        <li class="l">In this warm life-blood, which doth part</li>
        <li class="l">From thine, and wound me to the heart,</li>
        <li class="l">Yet could they not be clean, their stain</li>
        <li class="l">Is dyed in such a purple grain.</li>
        <li class="l">There is not such another in</li>
        <li class="l">The world to offer for their sin.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">Unconstant Sylvio, when yet</li>
        <li class="l">I had not found him counterfeit</li>
        <li class="l">One morning (I remember well)</li>
        <li class="l">Tied in this silver chain and bell,</li>
        <li class="l">Gave it to me; nay, and I know</li>
        <li class="l">What he said then; I’m sure I do.</li>
        <li class="l">Said he, “Look how your huntsman here</li>
        <li class="l">Hath taught a fawn to hunt his <span class="it">dear</span>.”</li>
        <li class="l">But Sylvio soon had me beguil’d,</li>
        <li class="l">This waxed tame, while he grew wild;</li>
        <li class="l">And quite regardless of my smart,</li>
        <li class="l">Left me his fawn, but took his heart.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">Thenceforth I set myself to play</li>
        <li class="l">My solitary time away,</li>
        <li class="l">With this, and very well content</li>
        <li class="l">Could so mine idle life have spent;</li>
        <li class="l">For it was full of sport, and light</li>
        <li class="l">Of foot and heart, and did invite</li>
        <li class="l">Me to its game; it seem’d to bless</li>
        <li class="l">Itself in me. How could I less</li>
        <li class="l">Than love it? Oh, I cannot be</li>
        <li class="l">Unkind t’ a beast that loveth me.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">Had it liv’d long, I do not know</li>
        <li class="l">Whether it too might have done so</li>
        <li class="l">As Sylvio did; his gifts might be</li>
        <li class="l">Perhaps as false or more than he.</li>
        <li class="l">But I am sure, for aught that I</li>
        <li class="l">Could in so short a time espy,</li>
        <li class="l">Thy love was far more better then</li>
        <li class="l">The love of false and cruel men.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">With sweetest milk and sugar first</li>
        <li class="l">I it at mine own fingers nurst;</li>
        <li class="l">And as it grew, so every day</li>
        <li class="l">It wax’d more white and sweet than they.</li>
        <li class="l">It had so sweet a breath! And oft</li>
        <li class="l">I blush’d to see its foot more soft</li>
        <li class="l">And white, shall I say than my hand?</li>
        <li class="l">Nay, any lady’s of the land.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">It is a wond’rous thing how fleet</li>
        <li class="l">’Twas on those little silver feet;</li>
        <li class="l">With what a pretty skipping grace</li>
        <li class="l">It oft would challenge me the race;</li>
        <li class="l">And when ’t had left me far away,</li>
        <li class="l">’Twould stay, and run again, and stay,</li>
        <li class="l">For it was nimbler much than hinds,</li>
        <li class="l">And trod, as on the four winds.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">I have a garden of my own,</li>
        <li class="l">But so with roses overgrown</li>
        <li class="l">And lilies, that you would it guess</li>
        <li class="l">To be a little wilderness;</li>
        <li class="l">And all the spring time of the year</li>
        <li class="l">It only loved to be there.</li>
        <li class="l">Among the beds of lilies I</li>
        <li class="l">Have sought it oft, where it should lie;</li>
        <li class="l">Yet could not, till itself would rise,</li>
        <li class="l">Find it, although before mine eyes;</li>
        <li class="l">For, in the flaxen lilies’ shade,</li>
        <li class="l">It like a bank of lilies laid.</li>
        <li class="l">Upon the roses it would feed</li>
        <li class="l">Until its lips ev’n seemed to bleed,</li>
        <li class="l">And then to me ’twould boldly trip</li>
        <li class="l">And print those roses on my lip.</li>
        <li class="l">But all its chief delight was still</li>
        <li class="l">On roses thus itself to fill,</li>
        <li class="l">And its pure virgin limbs to fold</li>
        <li class="l">In whitest sheets of lilies cold.</li>
        <li class="l">Had it liv’d long it would have been</li>
        <li class="l">Lilies without, roses within.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">O help, O help! I see it faint,</li>
        <li class="l">And die as calmly as a saint.</li>
        <li class="l">See how it weeps! The tears do come,</li>
        <li class="l">Sad, slowly dropping like a gum.</li>
        <li class="l">So weeps the wounded balsam, so</li>
        <li class="l">The holy frankincense doth flow;</li>
        <li class="l">The brotherless Heliades</li>
        <li class="l">Melt in such amber tears as these.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">I in a golden vial will</li>
        <li class="l">Keep these two crystal tears, and fill</li>
        <li class="l">It till it do o’erflow with mine,</li>
        <li class="l">Then place it in Diana’s shrine.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">Now my sweet fawn is vanish’d to</li>
        <li class="l">Whither the swans and turtles go,</li>
        <li class="l">In fair Elysium to endure</li>
        <li class="l">With milk-white lambs and ermines pure.</li>
        <li class="l">O do not run too fast, for I</li>
        <li class="l">Will but bespeak thy grave, and die.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="l">First my unhappy statue shall</li>
        <li class="l">Be cut in marble, and withal</li>
        <li class="l">Let it be weeping too; but there</li>
        <li class="l">Th’ engraver sure his art may spare,</li>
        <li class="l">For I so truly thee bemoan</li>
        <li class="l">That I shall weep though I be stone;</li>
        <li class="l">Until my tears, still dropping, wear</li>
        <li class="l">My breast, themselves engraving there.</li>
        <li class="l">There at my feet shalt thou be laid,</li>
        <li class="l">Of purest alabaster made;</li>
        <li class="l">For I would have thine image be</li>
        <li class="l">White as I can, though not as thee.</li>
