      As for the Indians, we have but few, and those fetched from other countries, some from the neighboring Islands, some from the mainland, which we make slaves. The women, who are better versed in ordering the cassava and making bread than the negroes, we employ for that purpose, as also for making mobbie [an alcoholic drink made from sweet potatoes]. The men we use for footmen and killing of fish, which they are good at. With their own bows and arrows they will go out and in a day’s time, kill as much fish, as will serve a family of a dozen persons, two or three days, if you can keep the fish so long. They are very active men, and apt to learn anything, sooner than the negroes, and as different from them in shape, almost as in color: the men very broad shouldered, deep breasted, with large heads, and their faces almost three square, broad about the eyes and temples, and sharp at the chin, their skins some of them brown, some a bright bay [reddish brown]. They are much craftier, and subtler then the negroes, and in their nature falser, but in their bodies more active. Their women have very small breasts, and have more of the shape of the Europeans than the negroes, their hair black and long, a great part whereof hangs down upon their backs, as low as their haunches, with a large lock hanging over either breast, which seldom or never curls. Clothes they scorn to wear, especially if they be well shaped; a girdle they use of tape, covered with little smooth shells of fishes, white, and from their flank of one side, to their flank on the other side, a fringe of blue bugle [flowers of the bugle plant?], which hangs so low as to cover their privities. We had an Indian woman, a slave in the house, who was of excellent shape and color, for it was a pure bright bay, small breasts, with the nipples of a porphyry color. This woman would not be wooed by any means to wear clothes. She chanced to be with child, by a Christian servant, and lodging in the Indian house, amongst other women of her own country, where the Christian servants, both men and women, came. And being very great [pregnant], and that her time was come to be delivered, loath to fall in labor before the men, walked down to a wood, in which was a pond of water, and there by the side of the pond, brought herself abed [gave birth]. And presently washing her child in some of the water of the pond, lapped it up in such rags, as she had begged of the Christians, and in three hours’ time came home, with her child in her arms, a lusty boy, frolic and lively.
