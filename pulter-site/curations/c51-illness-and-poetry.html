     <p>Pulter wasn’t the only seventeenth-century poet for whom illness was an occasion to contemplate mortality and to make verse. The poems gathered here suggest the different ways her contemporaries linked sickness and poetry.  Donne’s speaker, like Pulter’s, writes in the first person, depicting illness as preparation for death and salvation, but he addresses God directly. Jonson’s poem addresses Disease itself, blaming it for preying especially on ladies; the poem moves from concern for these preyed-upon ladies to a list of women whom disease should choose instead.  His poem suggests that women and disease go together. Herbert describes “mortification” at a remove, in the third person, bringing home the message that aging and illness instruct us in how to die.</p>
