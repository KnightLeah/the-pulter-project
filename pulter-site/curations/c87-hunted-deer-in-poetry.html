      Hunted deer appear in many earlier poems, especially by poets who imitated the fourteenth-century Italian poet Petrarch. A hunter pursuing a female deer is a prominent trope in Petrarchan literature, and one of the most famous examples is Thomas Wyatt’s “Whoso List to Hunt.” Notice that Wyatt’s speaker is the hunter, whereas Pulter’s speaker aligns herself with the deer.

      Pulter’s poem recalls some aspects of earlier hart emblems by George Wither and Frances Quarles that also compare a wounded hart to a distressed soul. Neither poet has the hart seek dittany; however, Quarles refers to medicinal salve (“balsam” or “treacle”). Wither’s deer runs to no place in particular as it tries to flee certain death.

      Quarles’s book of emblems includes two poems in which an arrow-struck hart seeks a stream. This image is drawn from Psalm 42, which begins, “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God” (King James Version). The first poem is accompanied by an illustration of someone rising from bed and a version of Song of Solomon, chapter 3, verse 2: “I will rise now, and go about the city, and will seek him that my soul loveth. I sought him, but I found him not.”

        <li class="l">There was a stag did in the forest lie,</li>
        <li class="l">Whose neck was long, and horns branched up high.</li>
        <li class="l">His haunch was broad, sides large, and back was long,</li>
        <li class="l">His legs were nervous, and his joints were strong.</li>
        <li class="l">His hair lay sleek and smooth upon his skin;</li>
        <li class="l">None in the forest might compare with him.</li>
        <li class="l">In summer’s heat he in cool brakes [bushes] him lays,</li>
        <li class="l">Which grew so high, kept off the sun’s hot rays.</li>
        <li class="l">In evenings cool or dewy mornings new</li>
        <li class="l">Would he rise up, and all the forest view.</li>
        <li class="l">Then walking to some clear and crystal brook,</li>
        <li class="l">Not for to drink, but on his horns to look,</li>
        <li class="l">Taking such pleasure in his stately crown,</li>
        <li class="l">His pride forgets that dogs might pull him down.</li>
        <li class="l">From thence unto a shady wood did go,</li>
        <li class="l">Where straightest pines and tallest cedars grow;</li>
        <li class="l">And upright olives, which th’ loving vine oft twines,</li>
        <li class="l">And slender birch bows head to golden mines.</li>

        <li class="l">The fatting chestnut and the hazel small,</li>
        <li class="l">The smooth-rind beech, which groweth large and tall.</li>
        <li class="l">The loving myrtle is for amorous kind,</li>
        <li class="l">The yielding willow, as inconstant mind.</li>
        <li class="l">The cypress sad, which makes the funeral hearse,</li>
        <li class="l">And sycamores, where lovers write their verse;</li>
        <li class="l">And juniper, which gives a pleasant smell,</li>
        <li class="l">And many more, which were too long to tell.</li>
        <li class="l">Round from their sappy roots sprout branches small,</li>
        <li class="l">Some call it underwood, that’s never tall.</li>
        <li class="l">There walking through, the stag was hindered much,</li>
        <li class="l">The bending twigs his horns would often catch.</li>
        <li class="l">While on the tender leaves and buds did browse,</li>
        <li class="l">His eyes were troubled with the broken boughs.</li>
        <li class="l">Then straight he seeks this labyrinth to unwind,</li>
        <li class="l">But hard it was his first way out to find.</li>
        <li class="l">Unto this wood a rising hill did join,</li>
        <li class="l">Where grew wild marjoram and sweet wild thyme,</li>
        <li class="l">And winter savory, which was never set,</li>
        <li class="l">On which the stag delighted much to eat.</li>
        <li class="l">But looking down upon the valleys low,</li>
        <li class="l">He sees the grass and cowslips thick to grow;</li>
        <li class="l">And springs, which dig themselves a passage out,</li>
        <li class="l">Much like as serpents wind each field about.</li>
        <li class="l">Rising in winter high do overflow,</li>
        <li class="l">The flowery banks, but rich the soil doth grow.</li>
        <li class="l">So as he went, thinking therein to feed,</li>
        <li class="l">He saw a field, which sowed was with wheat seed.</li>
        <li class="l">The blades were grown a handful high and more,</li>
        <li class="l">Which sight his taste did soon invite him o'er.</li>
        <li class="l">In haste goes on, feeds full, then down he lies,</li>
        <li class="l">The owner coming there, he soon espies;</li>
        <li class="l">Straight called his dogs to hunt him from that place,</li>
        <li class="l">At last it came to be a forest chase.</li>
        <li class="l">The chase grew hot, the stag apace did run,</li>
        <li class="l">Dogs followed close, and men for sport did come.</li>
        <li class="l">At last a troop of men, horse, dogs did meet,</li>
        <li class="l">Which made the hart to try his nimble feet.</li>
        <li class="l">Full swift he was, his horns he bore up high,</li>
        <li class="l">Then men did shout, the dogs ran yelping by;</li>
        <li class="l">And bugle horns with several notes did blow,</li>
        <li class="l">Huntsmen to cross the stag did sideways go.</li>
        <li class="l">The horses beat their hooves against dry ground,</li>
        <li class="l">Raising such clouds of dust, their ways scarce found.</li>
        <li class="l">Their sides ran down with sweat, as if they were</li>
        <li class="l">New come from watering, dropping every hair.</li>
        <li class="l">The dogs their tongues out of their mouths hung long,</li>
        <li class="l">Their sides did beat like feverish pulse so strong.</li>
        <li class="l">Their short ribs heave up high, then fall down low,</li>
        <li class="l">As bellows draw in wind the same to blow.</li>
        <li class="l">Men tawny grew, the sun their skins did turn,</li>
        <li class="l">Their mouths were dry, their bowels felt to burn.</li>
        <li class="l">The stag so hot as coals, when kindled through,</li>
        <li class="l">Yet swiftly ran when he the dogs did view.</li>
        <li class="l">Coming at length unto a river’s side,</li>
        <li class="l">Whose current flowed as with a falling tide;</li>
        <li class="l">Where he leaps in to quench his scorching heat,</li>
        <li class="l">To wash his sides, to cool his burning feet.</li>
        <li class="l">Hoping the dogs in water could not swim,</li>
        <li class="l">But he’s deceived: the dogs do enter in.</li>
        <li class="l">Like fishes, tried to swim in water low,</li>
        <li class="l">But out, alas, his horns too high do show.</li>
        <li class="l">When dogs were covered over head and ears,</li>
        <li class="l">No part is seen: only their nose appears.</li>
        <li class="l">The stag and river like a race did show,</li>
        <li class="l">He striving still the swift river to outgo.</li>
        <li class="l">Whilst men and horses ran the banks along,</li>
        <li class="l">Encouraging the dogs to follow on,</li>
        <li class="l">Where he on waters, like a looking glass,</li>
        <li class="l">By a reflection sees their shadows pass.</li>
        <li class="l">Fear cuts his breath off short, his limbs do shrink,</li>
        <li class="l">Like those the cramp doth take, to bottom sink.</li>
        <li class="l">Thus out of breath, no longer could he stay,</li>
        <li class="l">But leaps on land and swiftly runs away.</li>
        <li class="l">Change gave him ease, ease strength; in strength hope lives.</li>
        <li class="l">Hope joys the heart, or light heel joy still gives.</li>
        <li class="l">His feet like to a feathered arrow flies,</li>
        <li class="l">Or like a winged bird that mounts the skies.</li>
        <li class="l">The dogs like ships that sail with wind and tide,</li>
        <li class="l">Which cut the air and waters deep divide.</li>
        <li class="l">Or like a greedy merchant seeks for gain,</li>
        <li class="l">Will venture life, so traffics on the main.</li>
        <li class="l">The hunters, like to boys, no dangers shun,</li>
        <li class="l">To see a sight will venture life and limb;</li>
        <li class="l">Which sad become when mischief takes not place,</li>
        <li class="l">Is out of countenance, as with disgrace;</li>
        <li class="l">But when they see a ruin and a fall,</li>
        <li class="l">Return with joy, as conquerors they were all.</li>
        <li class="l">Thus their several passions their ways did meet,</li>
        <li class="l">As dogs’ desire to catch did make them fleet.</li>
        <li class="l">The stag with fear did run, his life to save,</li>
        <li class="l">Whilst men for love of mischief dig his grave.</li>
        <li class="l">The angry dust in every face up flies,</li>
        <li class="l">As with revenge, seeks to put out their eyes.</li>
        <li class="l">Yet they so fast went on with such loud cries,</li>
        <li class="l">The stag no hope had left, nor help espies;</li>
        <li class="l">His heart so heavy grew with grief and care</li>
        <li class="l">That his small feet his body could not bear.</li>
        <li class="l">Yet loath to die or yield to foes was he,</li>
        <li class="l">But to the last would strive for victory.</li>
        <li class="l">’Twas not for want of courage he did run,</li>
        <li class="l">But that an army against one did come.</li>
        <li class="l">Had he the valor of bold Caesar stout,</li>
        <li class="l">Must yield himself to them, or die no doubt.</li>
        <li class="l">Turning his head, as if he dared their spite,</li>
        <li class="l">Prepared himself against them all to fight.</li>
        <li class="l">Single he was, his horns were all his helps,</li>
        <li class="l">To guard him from a multitude of whelps.</li>
        <li class="l">Besides, a company of men were there,</li>
        <li class="l">If dogs should fail to strike him everywhere.</li>
        <li class="l">But to the last his fortune he’ll try out;</li>
        <li class="l">Then men and dogs do circle him about.</li>
        <li class="l">Some bite, some bark, all ply him at the bay,</li>
        <li class="l">Where with his horns he tosses some away.</li>
        <li class="l">But fate his thread had spun, so down did fall,</li>
        <li class="l">Shedding some tears at his own funeral.</li>
