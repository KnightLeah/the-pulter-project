    <p>In line 5 of this poem, Pulter uses the alchemical term “quintessence” to refer to the purest form of a substance. Pulter is claiming that no liquid, including the quintessence of alcohol, can enliven her depressed spirit. Jane Cavendish, a royalist poet and Margaret Cavendish’s stepdaughter, wrote the poem below in which she claims that the presence of her sister Elizabeth Egerton, later Countess of Bridgewater, is the quintessence of cordial (a medicinal substance) to Jane while they both anxiously await their father’s return from exile during the civil war years.</p>
