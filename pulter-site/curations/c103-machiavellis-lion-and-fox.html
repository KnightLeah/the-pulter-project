      Pulter’s construction of a scenario in which a lion king orders the killing of troublesome courtiers at the urging of a crafty fox may recall Niccolò Machiavelli’s famous advice that a ruler should be both a lion and a fox. In Chapter 18 (“In what manner Princes ought to keep their words,” pp. 135-141) of <span class="it">The Prince</span> Machiavelli advises the prince to use both force and cunning. In this passage Machiavelli counsels a ruler to deceive in order to manage his mischievous subjects. Pulter’s speaker, in contrast, condemns the cruel deceit of the fox who cures the lion king by dubious means.

        How commendable in a Prince it is to keepe his word, and live with integrity, not making use of cunning and subtlety, every one knows well: yet wee see by experience in these our dayes, that those Princes have effected great matters, who have made small reckoning of keeping their words, and have known by their craft to turne and wind men about, and in the end have overcome those who have grounded upon the truth. You must then know, there are two kinds of combating or fighting; the one by right of the laws, the other meerly by force. That first way is proper to men, the other is also common to beasts: but because the first many times suffices not, there is a necessity to make recourse to the second; …  A Prince then being necessitated to know how to make use of that part belonging to a beast, ought to serve himselfe of the conditions of the Foxe and the Lion; for the Lion cannot keep himself from snares, nor the Foxe defend himselfe against the Wolves. Hee had need then bee a Foxe, that hee may beware of the snares, and a Lion, that he may scarre the Wolves. Those that stand wholly upon the Lion, understand not well themselves. And therefore a wise Prince cannot, nor ought not keep his faith given, when the observance therof turnes to disadvantage, and the occasions that made him promise, are past. For if men were all good, this rule would not be allowable; but being they are full of mischiefe, and would not make it good to thee, neither art thou tyed to keep it with them: nor shall a Prince ever want lawfull occasions to give colour to this breach. Very many moderne examples hereof might be alleag’d, wherin might be shewd how many peaces concluded, and how many promises made, have been violated and broken by the infidelity of Princes; and ordinarily things have best succeeded with him that hath been neerest the Foxe in condition. But it is necessary to understand how to set a good colour upon this disposition, and to bee able to faine and dissemble throughly; and men are so simple and yeeld so much to the present necessities, that hee who hath a mind to deceive, shall alwayes find another that will be deceived.
