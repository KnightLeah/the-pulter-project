      Pulter’s tiger gazes into a specific kind of mirror: a “crystal glass.” English mirrors in the first half of the sixteenth century in England were most commonly made of reflective metal. When crystal glass mirrors began to be imported from Continental Europe by the 1570s, several writers discussed the relative merits of this new luxury item compared to the more traditional polished steel mirrors. When Pulter wrote her tiger emblem more than half a century later, the technology of crystal glass was no longer new, but her emphasis on the mirror’s material engages with a decades-old discourse about the connotations of that particular kind of glass.

        The crystal glass mirror was neither a distorted reflection, nor required polishing, and thus in no way served as a reminder that God alone sees and judges each person as he or she truly is. Indeed the clarity of the reflection seems to have been perceived by some as a usurpation of divine vision. Wearing a mirror to church flaunts this usurpation in the very place where one should be most conscious of being seen by God. The mirror had for so many centuries served as a figure of God’s divine creation that it was an affront, or so it seemed, that any bourgeois citizen could produce in an instant, and without any effort or travail, a counterfeit image of crystal clarity.

      Several Christian writers in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries called their works “mirrors.” Puritan Samuel Clarke titled his 1646 book <span class="it">A Mirror or Looking-Glass, Both for Saints and Sinners</span>. Thomas Salter’s <span class="it">The Mirror of Modesty</span> (1579) begins with a note to his readers that identifies the treatise specifically as a “crystal glass.”

        In my judgment there is nothing more meet, especially for young maidens, than a mirror, therein to see and behold how to order their doing. I mean not a crystal mirror made by handy art, by which maidens nowadays do only take delight daily to trick and trim their tresses, standing tooting* two hours by the clock, looking now on this side, now on that, least anything should be lacking needful to further pride, not suffering so much as a hair to hang out of order. No, I mean no such mirror, but the mirror I mean is made of another manner of matter and is of much more worth than any crystal mirror; for as the one teacheth how to attire the outward body, so the other guideth to garnish the inward mind and maketh it meet for virtue, and therefore is entitled a mirror, meet for matrons and maidens, for matrons to know how to train up such young maidens as are committed to their charge and tuition,** and for maidens how to behave themselves to attain to the seat of good fame.

      In a satire by George Gascoigne, crystal glass represents everything that is wrong with English society.
