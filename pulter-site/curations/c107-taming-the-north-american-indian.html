      <p>Just as the hunter masters the whale in “This Huge Leviathan” (Emblem 42), the Spanish attempted to master the Indigenous peoples of Florida, where the story of this whale hunt originates (see the Curation <a class="pp-curation-ref" href="/poems/ae/this-huge-leviathan/#whaling-legends" target="_blank">Whaling Legends</a>). Conquistador Juan Ponce de León claimed Florida for Spain in 1513, christening it “La Florida” after the flowers in bloom there when he arrived in springtime. The colony stretched across a much broader territory than the U.S. state does today, encompassing parts of what are now Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Key to Spain’s strategy to govern this new colony was the establishment of missions, where Jesuit and later Franciscan priests were sent to convert the Indigenous peoples to what they considered the one true faith, Christianity. In total, there were over 100 missions, churches, or other sites where priests preached to an Indigenous audience in Florida in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries<sup>1</sup>. In Emblem 42, Pulter aligns the Indigenous hunter with the Devil, an attitude shared by Spanish explorers and missionaries; at best, the Indigenous inhabitants were seen as heathens, an uncivilized people requiring re-education in matters of spirituality, and at worst, instruments of the Devil. Philip IV, King of Spain, declared in a royal decree to the Spanish officials of Florida in 1651 that his “intent and only interest in Florida . . . was to further the work of holy conversion, . . . that the Indians willingly submit to the holy evangelical yoke<sup>2</sup> without their being harassed or molested<sup>3</sup>.” Submission to the might of God was inextricably linked to acquiescence to Spanish rule. In actuality, missionaries were accompanied by bands of soldiers who evinced little compunction about using force against Indigenous peoples.
      </p>
      <p>One of the first missions was established on the land of the Tequesta, on the Bay of Biscay at the mouth of the Miami River. It was here that the whale hunt on which Pulter’s poem is based was observed (see the Curation <a class="pp-curation-ref" href="/poems/ae/this-huge-leviathan/#whaling-legends" target="_blank">Whaling Legends </a>). In 1567, Pedro Menéndez Márquez, an explorer later appointed governor of Florida, passed through the area and left thirty soldiers, some carpenters, and a Jesuit brother named Francisco Villareal to build a church there<sup>4</sup>. A letter written by Brother Villareal to a fellow missionary on the west coast of Florida survives. He composed the letter on January 29, 1568, almost a year after his arrival. He corroborates stories of Tequesta whale-hunting, mentioning their consumption of whale meat. Villareal portrays himself as a teacher and the Tequesta people as students learning scripture through exercises in recitation.</p>

          I and all of us here remain in good health, glory to God who helps us to endure in this land trials which would appear insufferable in another place. I say this for we have had for the past three months or more a plague of mosquitoes so bad that I spent several days and nights without being able to sleep an hour. On top of this we suffered some days for lack of food. I say no more about this but to add that the only sleep we could obtain was close to the fire and half smothered in the smoke, otherwise one could not endure it. At this time the majority of the Indians went to an island a league from here to eat coconuts and palm grapes. No more than 30 remained here. It was then I went to Havana and spent some twenty days in going and coming. I confessed to the priest and took communion. I brought back some food but very little since there was no boat in which to bring it. I have been teaching the doctrine to the Indians or [<span class="it">sic</span>] up to fifteen years of age, the others will not come to the lessons although I believe there is none who does not say he wants to become a Christian but in the matter of learning the doctrine they find great difficulty and thus do not come to the classes. Those who attend, most of them, know the four prayers and nearly all the commandments. There are many here now because some of the nearby villages have come in to help in building a house for the chief. They now have food from the whales they kill and from fish. Before they suffered from hunger for two or three months so that they failed to attend because they all said they were hungry and begged [that little which I had]* to give them . . . I teach the doctrine in the house of the chief where many adults are present and I believe they learn it too although they do not recite it like the children. I think the chief is learning too, I teach them the prayers and commandments and afterwards the credo*. They say the words in their language so they can understand it.

      <p>The letter is also notable for Villareal’s description of the staging of two comedies, one of which he describes as a morality play. Morality plays were popular in fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century Europe and featured characters representative of virtue and vice designed to teach lessons about sin and salvation. The letter is ambiguous about the intended audience of the play; Villareal says that the soldiers “enjoyed” the play, but whether they were actors or audience members (or both) is unclear. It seems likely that the play was organized by Villareal with an eye to the religious education of a Tequesta audience as well as the entertainment of the soldiers. Perhaps he thought the visual medium of a play would help convey a message of faith to those who did not speak Spanish.</p>

          We hold fiestas* with litanies* to the cross. We have put on two comedies[,] one on the day of St. John* when we were expecting the governor.* This play had to do with the war between men and the world, the flesh and the devil. The soldiers enjoyed it very much.

      <p>The letter mentions obstacles encountered by the Spanish men, including illness and insufficient food. Villareal’s mission would be cut short in just a few months. By spring, the soldiers’ number dropped to eighteen and they were ordered to retreat. Lack of food, strained relations with the Tequesta, and “the seeming fruitlessness of missionary work” all contributed to the abandonment of the mission. It appears that the lack of food caused a rift between the soldiers and the Tequesta people, which came to a head when the soldiers murdered the chief’s uncle<sup>6</sup>. Attempts were made to re-establish the mission in 1568 and again in 1743, without success<sup>7</sup>. The Tequesta mission exhibited many of the problems that plagued later missions in Florida: Indigenous populations were devastated by European diseases like smallpox, measles, and typhus, as well as by the raids of the English colonizers and their Indigenous allies from Carolina<sup>8</sup>. When Spain ceded Florida to England in 1763, the remaining Tequestan families, of which there were only eighty, were given passage to Havana, where they remained under Spanish rule.<sup>9</sup></p>
