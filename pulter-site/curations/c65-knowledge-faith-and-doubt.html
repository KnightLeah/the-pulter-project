      ’The Hope’ is a poem about the balance between faith and doubt and the role of knowledge in the interplay of these. The phrase which closes the poem, “I know not how,” might express doubt, or faith, in the absence of knowledge. Alice Eardley’s essay, excerpted here, analyses the importance of Pulter’s punctuation in the impact of this phrase. George Herbert’s poem ’The Thanksgiving’ closes with a similar expression of not knowing, while Margaret Cavendish’s poem ’Of the Subtlety of Motion’ adapts this position to the context of more philosophical and scientific poems.

      <p>
        In Pulter’s poem a full stop appears about two thirds of the way along the final line of the poem and is the only full stop in the entire composition … In Pulter’s poem the full stop marks an abrupt hiatus, disrupting not just the line within which it appears but the poem as a whole … The full stop in the final line curtails the forward thrust of the poem and highlights the ways in which, right up until that point, the poem consistently pushes beyond its own structural boundaries … The poem is a type of sonnet, evoking and then flouting the expectations of readers attuned to sonnet convention. It begins with a quatrain within which a single unit of meaning is neatly contained; Death is appealed to and challenged to reduce the narrator’s body to dust. But if the reader is expecting, on this basis, a second contained quatrain he or she will be disappointed. The next four lines initially appear to be complete in themselves but in fact the meaning of the poem overspills into the next line and pushes on for another six. During the course of these six lines, the poem becomes increasingly unrestrained; line 11 is insufficient to contain meaning, which spills out into line 12, a point highlighted by the mid-line comma. Line 15 is the closing line of a triplet, breaking beyond the limits of the couplets regulating the poem as a whole. The last vestiges of sonnet are disrupted as the poem surpasses the fourteen-line limit. It is clear that this structure is designed to reflect the verbal meaning of the poem, which anticipates the disintegration of the human form into atoms. It is also characteristic of Pulter’s poetry in that it reflects the fluidity and gathering momentum of a train of thought. This is not the first place Pulter introduces a dramatic hiatus just at the moment when a particular reverie reaches a point at which it cannot, or should not, go, usually, as in this instance, when it begins to encroach on divine mysteries.
