      A key term in this poem is “suspire,” meaning to sigh or breathe out. Pulter uses the word only a few times in her poetry, but it is part of a matrix of related words that Pulter frequently employs connected to sighs and breathing. Her manuscript is titled “Poems Breathed Forth,” and she imagines “suspiring” while weeping in <a href="/poems/10" title="Read “Upon the Death of My Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter” (Poem 10)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Upon the Death of My Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</span><span class="idx">10</span></a> and <a href="/poems/14" title="Read “On the Horrid Murder of That Incomparable Prince” (Poem 14)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">On the Horrid Murder of That Incomparable Prince</span><span class="idx">14</span></a>. “Suspire” is not often used in the period, but it appears in some literary texts.
