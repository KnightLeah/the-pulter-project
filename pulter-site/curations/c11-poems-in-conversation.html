    <p>Pulter may borrow her opening phrase (“Tell me no more”) and dialogic structure, imagining and rebuffing an interlocutor, from other seventeenth-century poems. Her poem is thus about a kind of conversation and itself in conversation with a poetic convention.</p>

    <p>One can learn about the poetic conversation into which Pulter enters in Scott Nixon, “‘Ask me no more’ and the Manuscript Verse Miscellany,”
      <span class="it">English Literary Renaissance</span> 29.1 (1999): 97-130; and Marcy L. North, “Women’s Literary and Intellectual Endeavors: A Case for the Anonymous Riposte,”
      <span class="it">A Companion to British Literature</span> 2, eds. Robert DeMaria, Jr., Heesok Chang, Samantha Zacher (Wiley-Blackwell, 2014), 142-163.</p>

        <p>1. Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, Count of Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador to England from 1613-1622, and a notorious figure associated with Catholic intrigue. The Black Knight in Thomas Middleton’s play <span class="it">A Game at Chess</span> (1624) seems to be based on him; he also appears in the popular satirical pamphlet by Thomas Scott, <span class="it">The Second Part of Vox Populi, or Gondomar Appearing in the Likeness of Matchiavell in a Spanish Parliament</span> (London, 1624). The particular visibility of Gondomar in 1624 follows his role in an attempt to broker a “Spanish match” between Prince Charles (the future Charles I) and the Spanish Infanta (Maria Anna). Negotiations proceeded on and off for years, breaking off ignominiously in 1623; Gondomar left London to return to Spain in 1622. Vilifications of Gondomar proliferated after that; his name continued to be synonymous with Catholic scheming long after Charles married a French princess and long after Gondomar died in 1626. For example, <span class="it">The Second Part of Vox Populi</span> was reprinted in 1642, when suspicion of Charles I and his Catholic sympathies intensified as civil war erupted.</p>
        <p>2. Messalina was the third wife of the Roman emperor Claudius. Her name became synonymous with promiscuity because of slanders whose accuracy we should question. The most influential is embedded in Pliny’s account of “the generation of all kinds of animals.” This is chapter 83 of Book 10 of his <span class="it">Natural History</span>, a text with which Pulter seems to have been familiar. In this chapter, Pliny laments that while other creatures have fixed times and seasons for mating, only humans do not and, what’s more, are sexually insatiable. He documents what he views as the depravity of human sexuality by referring to a sexual contest between Messalina and a prostitute, for which he appears to be the sole source: “Messalina, the wife of Claudius Cæsar, thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress, selected, for the purpose of deciding the question, one of the most notorious of the women who followed the profession of a hired prostitute; and the empress outdid her, after continuous intercourse, night and day, at the twenty-fifth embrace. In the human race also, the men have devised various substitutes for the more legitimate exercise of passion, all of which outrage Nature; while the females have recourse to abortion. How much more guilty than the brute beasts are we in this respect!” Messalina was executed for plotting to murder her husband, the emperor; we could view her as a rebel or a traitor rather than a whore.</p>

        <div class="src">Source: This poem circulated in manuscript without attribution. I here modernize Nixon’s transcription of the version recorded in British Library, Harley MS 6918  (H), fol. 41 (Scott Nixon, “‘Ask me no more’ and the Manuscript Verse Miscellany,” <span class="it">English Literary Renaissance</span>, 29.1 [1999]: 97-130, pp. 120-121). According to Nixon, “The poem is an anti-blazon, which piles increasingly outrageous insults upon one another. It might be argued that this poem picks up the misogyny inherent in the original lyric, as the male speaker seeks to define and hence control the mind and body of his female addressee” (121). We might add that the poem also relies on a racist discourse that associates ugliness with blackness, appalling noise with Irish mourners, and corruption with the Spanish and Catholics.</div>
