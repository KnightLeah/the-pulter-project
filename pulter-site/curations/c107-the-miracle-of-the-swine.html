      <p>Among the miracles performed by Christ is the Miracle of the Swine, alluded to in lines 27-28 of “This Huge Leviathan” (Emblem 42). He exorcises a group of demons (who call themselves “Legion”) from a man by transferring them into a herd of pigs. When they become possessed, the pigs run into the sea and drown. The story appears in the New Testament in Matthew 8:28–34, Mark 5:1–20, and Luke 8:26–39.</p>

          <li class="l">And when he [i.e., Jesus Christ] was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out</li>
          <li class="l t-2">of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</li>
          <li class="l">Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</li>
         <li class="l">Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been</li>
         <li class="l t-2"> plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man</li>
          <li class="l t-2">tame him.</li>
          <li class="l">And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting</li>
          <li class="l t-2">himself with stones.</li>
          <li class="l">But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</li>
          <li class="l">And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the</li>
          <li class="l">most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</li>
         <li class="l"> For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</li>
          <li class="l">And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for</li>
          <li class="l t-2">we are many.</li>
          <li class="l">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</li>
          <li class="l">Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</li>
          <li class="l">And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into </lil>
          <li class="l t-2">them.</li>
          <li class="l">And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into</li>
          <li class="l">the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were </li>
          <li class="l t-2">about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</li></ul>
