      Pulter often personifies the planets and astronomical events (dusk, dawn). This is a convention in Latin and Renaissance English poetry. Here we see Christopher Marlowe’s translation of an Ovid elegy addressed to Aurora and an excerpt from an Aemelia Lanyer poem in which she links Aurora and Phoebe, as Pulter does.

        <li class="l">Not one in heaven should be more base and vile.</li>
        <li class="l">Thou leav’st his bed, because he’s faint through age,</li>
        <li class="l">And early mount’st thy hateful carriage,</li>
        <li class="l">But held’st thou in thine arms some Cephalus,</li>
        <li class="l">Then would’st thou cry: “stay night and run not thus!”</li>
        <li class="l">Dost punish me, because years make him wane?</li>
        <li class="l">I did not bid thee wed an aged swain!</li>
        <li class="l">The moon sleeps with Endymion every day;</li>
        <li class="l">Thou art as fair as she––then kiss and play.</li>
        <li class="l">Jove, that thou should’st not haste but wait his leisure,</li>
        <li class="l">Made two nights one to finish up his pleasure.</li>
        <li class="l">I chid no more; she blushed and therefore heard me.</li>
        <li class="l">Yet lingered not the day, but morning scared me.</li>
