  What is the purpose of political poetry? Does poetry merely reflect political events, or can it actually effect political change? In this curation are four very different approaches to political poetry written during the English Civil Wars, meant to set off and highlight the different poles between which Pulter’s “Invitation into the Country” so deftly moves. Richard Lovelace’s poem “The Snail” is perhaps the best example of one extreme, in which the poet responds to political defeat with images of retreat and closed circles, fantasizing about curling up within oneself.

<p>
  If Lovelace’s poem admires the closed circle of the snail, Alexander Brome’s poem “The Royalist,” which he precisely dates to 1646 (a year before Pulter’s “Invitation into the Country, … 1647”) valorizes a circle of imprisoned carousers. They are closed in and closed off, but resolved nevertheless to “tipple” their cares away, supposedly as a form of political rebellion (“In vain they’l think their plagues are spent, / When once they see we don’t repine”; ll. 15–16).

<p>
  Andrew Marvell’s poem “The Garden” is less insouciant than Brome’s “The Royalist,” but it also fantasizes about escape and withdrawal, particularly, like Pulter’s poem, withdrawal into the country. Such a retreat into nature, the poem imagines, may allow him to transcend worldly troubles, converting potentially political impulses instead to “a green thought in a green shade” (ll. 47–48).

  <ul class="lg">
    <li class="l">What wondrous life is this I lead!</li>
    <li class="l">Ripe apples drop about my head;</li>

  Compare, then, these poetic visions of escape and transcendance to the following call to action called “The Digger’s Song.” The Diggers were an agrarian communist group advocating for the common use of common land (see the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Digger"><span class="it">Encyclopedia Britannica</span></a>). Their song below is a chant and call to action; less beautifully crafted and emotionally stirring, perhaps, than the samples of Royalist poetry given above, it is nevertheless potentially stirring in other ways, and the penultimate stanza contains an explicit dig at Cavaliers or Royalists, whose verse serves only, they say, “to please the singing boyes” (l. 54).
