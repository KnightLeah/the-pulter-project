    <p>Among the natural histories that provide descriptions of porcupines are Pliny’s, a volume which we know Pulter consulted, and Du Bartas’s (translated by Josuah Sylvester), which she might or might not have known. Du Bartas’s poem was a popular work that offered a catalogue of animals in relation to God’s creation of the world.

          </ul>
          <p>The Porkpens come out of India and Africke: a kind of Vrchin or hedge-hog they be: armed with pricks they be both; but the Porkpen hath the longer sharp pointed quilles, and those, when he stretcheth his skin, he sendeth and shooteth from him: when the hounds presseth hard vpon him, he flieth from their mouthes, and then takes vantage to launce at them somwhat farther off. In the Winter he lieth hidden, as the nature is of many beasts to doe, and the Beares aboue the rest.</p>
