    <p>Pulter’s poem joins other notable elegies written about the death of a child in seventeenth-century England, including the following by Ben Jonson, Katherine Philips, Elizabeth Egerton, and Anne Bradstreet. Pulter did not always heed one strand of conventional advice to mothers about grief, as evidenced here in a final excerpt by John Milton.</p>

      <p>My sorrow is great I confess. I am much grieved for the loss of my dear girl Keatty who was as fine a child as
        could be. She was but a year and ten months old when, by the fatal disease of the smallpox, it was God’s
        pleasure to take her from me, who spoke anything one bid her, and would call for anything at dinner, and make
        her mind known at any time, and was kind to all, even to strangers, and had no anger in her.</p>
      <p class="ind">All thought she loved them. Her brothers and sister loved her with a fond love. She was so good, she never
        slept nor played at sermon nor prayers. She had received the sacrament of baptism which washed her from her
        original sin, and she lived holily. She took delight in nothing but me if she had seen me; if absent, ever had
        me in her words, desiring to come to me. Never was there so fond a child of a mother.</p>
      <p class="ind">But she now is not in this world which grieves my heart, even my soul. But I must submit and give God my
        thanks that He once was pleased to bestow so great a blessing as that sweet child upon me.</p>

    <p>Pulter did not take the counsel of Renaissance writers who urged mothers to contain their immoderate grief and experience the joy of their child being embraced by God in the afterlife. In the final stanza of his poem, “On the Death of a Fair Infant Dying of Cough,” John Milton, for instance, offers advice to a grieving mother:</p>

      <ul class="lg">
        <li class="l">Then thou the mother of so sweet a child</li>
        <li class="l">Her false imagin’d loss cease to lament,</li>
        <li class="l">And wisely learn to curb thy sorrows wild;</li>
        <li class="l">Think what a present thou to God hast sent,</li>
        <li class="l">And render him with patience what he lent;</li>
        <li class="l">This if thou do, he will an off-spring give</li>
        <li class="l">That till the worlds last end shall make thy name to live.</li>
