    <p>Cosmic pluralism, or the plurality of worlds, is the philosophical belief that there are numerous planets, potentially inhabited, orbiting around numerous stars (or suns). While the scientific confirmation of the existence of extra-solar planets occurred only in the twentieth century, the astronomical discoveries of the early modern period revived interest in this ancient theory. “The Wish” is one of many seventeenth-century poems that speculate about multiple suns, planets, or peoples.</p>

    <p>Though it focuses on the moon rather than the sun or other planets, the following text, and its expanded, second edition, <span class="it">A Discourse concerning a New world & Another Planet in 2 Books</span> (1640), is important for popularizing ideas about cosmic pluralism in English.</p>

      <p class="ind">I have already handled the Seasons and Meteors belonging to this new World: ’tis requisite that in the next place I should come unto the third thing which I promised, and to say somewhat of the inhabitants, concerning whom there might be many difficult questions raised, as whether that place be more inconvenient for habitation then our World (as <span class="it">Kepler</span> thinkes) whether they are the seed of <span class="it">Adam</span>, whether they are there in a blessed estate, or else what meanes there may be for their salvation, with many other such uncertaine enquiries, which I shall willingly omit, leaving it to their examination, who have more leisure and learning for the search of such particulars.</p>
      <p class="ind">Being for mine own part content only to set down such notes belonging unto these which I have observed in other Writers. <span class="it">Cum tota illa regio nobis ignota fit, remanent inhabitatores illi ignoti penitas</span>, (saith <span class="it">Cusanus</span>) since we know not the regions of that place, wee must be altogether ignorant of the inhabitants. There hath not yet beene any such discovery concerning these, upon which wee may build a certainty, or good probability: well may wee guesse at them, and that too very doubtfully, but we can know nothing, for if we doe hardly guesse aright at things which be upon earth, if with labour wee doe finde the things that are at hand, how then can wee search out those things that are in Heaven? What a little is that which wee know? In respect of those many matters contained within this great Universe, this whole globe of earth and water? Though it seeme to us to be of a large extent, yet it beares not so great a proportion unto the whole frame of Nature, as a small sand doth unto it; and what can such little creatures as wee discerne, who are tied to this point of earth? Or what can they in the Moone know of us? If we understand any thing (saith <span class="it">Esdras</span>) ’tis nothing but that which is upon the earth, and hee that dwelleth above in the Heavens, may onely understand the things that are above in the height of the heavens.</p>
      <p class="ind">So that ’twere a very needelesse thing for us, to search after any particulars, however, wee may guesse in the generall, that there are some inhabitants in that Planet: for why else did Providence furnish that place with all such conveniences of habitation as have beene above declared[?] ...</p>
