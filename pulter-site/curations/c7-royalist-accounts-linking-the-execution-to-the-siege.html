      Parliamentary forces laid siege to the town of Colchester beginning June 12, 1648. By the time of Lucas and Lisle’s executions in late August, then, the situation in Colchester was desperate. One historian calls the siege “a central event of the second civil war and a focus of national attention in private letters and public print” (Barbara Donegan, <span class="it">War in England, 1642-49</span> [Oxford UP, 2008], 313). As usual during the English Civil Wars and, indeed, in any conflict, the two sides disagreed about what happened and why and whether this was a justified act of war or a war crime. Here are two Royalist accounts of the siege, which place particular emphasis on the ransacking of the Lucas family home, the breaking open of the Lucas family tomb, and the desecration of the remains of the sister and mother of Charles Lucas and Margaret Lucas Cavendish. While these are often cited as evidence of what happened, we should evaluate them critically as partisan accounts. See Frances E. Dolan, “Scattered Remains and Paper Bodies: Margaret Cavendish and the Siege of Colchester,” <span class="it">postmedieval</span> 4.4 (2013): 452-464.

        When these two true English worthies came to the place appointed for execution (scarce to be believed amongst Christians or men of humanity) there came Col. Ireton, Rainsborow, and Whaley to be as well spectators as actors, in this inhumane tragedy; to make their eyes witnesses (though not their souls sensible) of their unchristianity.

        Where they found the loyal gents, ready to be sacrificed, and with as undaunted resolutions to receive death there as ever before they dared it in the field, where the boldest rebel never gained honor by questioning their gallantry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Charles being the first that was to receive this honor of martyrdom told them that ‘he had often looked death in the face in the field, and now they should see he durst die.’ Then having a little while retired himself upon his knees, he rose up with a cheerful countenance and, opening his doublet, showed them his breast, and setting his hands to his sides calls out to them, ‘See, I am ready for you! Now rebels do your worst!’ So they immediately fired at him and shot him in four places, so that he was suddenly dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Sir George Lisle, his turn being next (being before carried a little aside, that he might not see his friend fall), was brought to the place to perform the conclusive part of this bloody scene; and viewing the body of his dear friend and fellow martyr dead and bleeding on the ground, kneeled down and kissed it sobbing forth a funeral elegy in many sweet characters of his peerless and unspotted honor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then standing up, [he] took out of his pocket five pieces of gold (the whole stock he had about him) and gave one of them to his executioners, and the rest to a gentleman then standing by (who formerly had been his servant) to deliver as his last legacy to some friends in London, with some filial expressions of duty to his father and mother, and recommendations to some other friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then turning to the spectators said: ‘Oh! How many of your lives here have I saved in hot blood, and must now myself be most barbarously murdered in cold? But what dare not they do that would willingly cut the throat of my dear King, whom they have already imprisoned, and for whose deliverance, and peace to this unfortunate nation, I dedicate my last prayers to Heaven? And now, traitors, do your worst.’ Then standing regardless of them with many invocations on the name of Jesus, was suddenly also thrown dead on the ground, which place left there should want a monument of that cruel murder to all eternity, I am informed (by those, and they diverse, who have since viewed it) is yet bare of grass and cannot be forced by any art to bear any.

        … And having thus possessed themselves of this [the Lucas family] house, (as it is their custom in all other places, the first thing thought on is plunder) they fell to searching the house; and those things that were in it moveable, though little of worth or conveniency, they took away––which could be little more than bedsteads, and stools, and the like, that house having been divers times before, and indeed the first in the kingdom, as is believed, plundered. But finding themselves no better rewarded for their service, that they might be more notorious in their villainy, broke up the vault wherein the ancestors of that family were usually interred, under the pretense of searching for money, and finding them not yet quit dissolved––the corpses of the Lady Lucas, and the Lady Killigrew (as I received it from eye witnesses), wrapped in lead––they tore open that coffin, beyond whatever was known or read of before, or amongst the most inhumane barbarous thoughts, dismembered their trunks, throwing a leg in one corner of the vault, and arm in another, and were so impudent in this so and worse than brutish act, as to bear away the hair of their heads in their hats as a triumphant bravado in honor to their villany. In which posture the vault continued, till the corpse of Sir C. Lucas, that loyal martyr, was brought to possess it. Is not that commonwealth happy that must receive a reformation from such saints, who have these ten years been practicing acts, absolutely monstrous to even nature itself, beyond parallel, precedent, or political complotment of the most subtle machiavillain or bloody tyrants in the world.

        The enemy being possessed of the house, exercised their brutal rage upon the bare walls, for there was nothing else that remained, this being one of the first houses in England which suffered by that fatal liberty of the subject, which the profane vulgar in the beginning of these disorders so passionately petitioned the Parliament to grant them; who intending to serve themselves of their blind fury, not only suffered but applauded their violence to their neighbors; but like unskilfull conjurors they often raised those spirits which they could [not] lay; for under cover of zeal to the cause, the poor levelled the rich of both parties and . . .

        There joined to the house a chappel, under which was a vault, the burial place of this honorable family. Here their officers and soldiers entered, and broke open the tombs of their ancestors, amongst whom the Lady Lucas and Lady Killigrew, the mother and sister of the present Lord Lucas, were so lately buried, that their sinews and hair were unconsumed.

        Then they scattered the bones about with profane jests, and cut off the hair and wore it in their hats.
