                    <p>This Ancient Greek goddess was often represented in early modern European images carrying a bridle and either a whip or rod to symbolise her role in measuring people’s actions and, if necessary, forcefully restraining their excesses. The bridle symbolised how Nemesis checks the desire to exceed one’s limits; the whip symbolised the punishment awaiting those who could not exercise that control. This much-translated and influential Latin emblem, by Andrea Alciato, depicts Nemesis with a bridle, and associates her with the advice: “Injure no-one, by word or deed.” (<span class="it">Nec verbo nec facto quenquam laedendum</span>).</p>

                        <p>It is written with Pausanias [the Ancient Greek historian], that Nemesis was the most seuere and cruell punisher of arrogancie & vainglory of all others, & saith, that she abased & brought downe the insolencie and ouer-weening boldnesse of the northerne barbarous people, who with an assured conquest and victorie (as they thought) entered into the countries of the Athenians, and there (scorning as it should seeme) their small forces and resistances, fell to spoile and rifeling, and presently set up and erected their huge Colossus, or piller of marble, which they of purpose brought with them to ingrave and set forth their victories, trophies, and spoiles that they should make of their enemies: but being afterward overcome themselves, & beaten back into their countries, the same stone the Athenians caused to be consecrated vnto Nemesis, whose picture and counter fet by the incomparable skill of Phidias, was most curiously and exactly ingraven thereon, to shew therby, that shee only was the cause of the cleane subverting and expelling their fatall enemies out of their Countrey, and that shee therein extended her power and office to the revenging and abolishing the ouerhaughtie attempts of pride, & foole-hardie presumption.</p>
                        <p>And in that she was thus held to be punisher of vaine humors, and prowd demeanures of mortals, the Ancients also held and supposed her to bee the verie same in nature and propertie as the goddesse <span class="it">Iustitia</span> [Justice].</p>
