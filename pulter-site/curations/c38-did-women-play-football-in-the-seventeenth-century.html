    <p>Probably not. Pulter imagines fleeing the confines of earth and playing football with the stars at line 12, but contemporary drama suggests that the idea of women playing football was either an occasion for smutty jokes (as in James Shirley’s play, extracted below) or for lamenting the manliness of women in the region of Savoy (as in Thomas Killigrew’s play, extracted below).</p>

      <p>I find <span class="it">Orante</span> has no great kindness for the Prince nor People; yet he cannot deny the Princess <span class="it">Clorinda</span> is a strange example of Virtue and Courage; she fears no wounds nor dangers.</p>
      <p class="ind"><span class="it">Orante</span>.</p>
      <p>She will play at foot-ball, thresh, and hew woods, as well as her Brother; Alass, Sir, ’tis not there as in <span class="it">Rome</span>, and the Eastern World, where the Women are soft, bred nice, and full of tender thoughts; Here is no difference betwixt the Sexes, but that they esteem them less then Men: Their Cowes plow too, and their Mares bear burthens, and their Women fight. No beast of that Country has any priviledge; and I wonder at nothing so much as the <span class="it">Roman</span> Curiosity, that has made Warr thus long against this waspes nest in a Rock. By all our Gods, we never thought their Country worth asking for, we onely banish’d Malefactors thither; and they have chosen rather to return and die here, then live and wither out their daies in that nest of Winter. Cold, Poverty, and Ignorance, are the onely commodities, I know, their Country affords.</p>
