      While mountebanks are usually defined as crooks and impostors who trade in false promises and claim knowledge they
      don’t have, in the seventeenth century it was not always easy to distinguish them from other medical practitioners
      or from other entertainers and orators.

      <p>
        I hope it will not be esteemed for an impertinency to my discourse, if I next speak of the mountebanks of
        Venice, seeing amongst many other things that do much famous this city [make this city famous], these two sorts
        of people, namely the courtesans [whom he has just discussed at length] and the mountebanks, are not the least.
        For although there are mountebanks also in other cities of Italy, yet because there is a greater concourse of
        them in Venice than elsewhere, and that of the better sort and the most eloquent fellows, and also for that
        there is a larger toleration of them here than in other cities (for in Rome, etc. they are restrained from
        certain matters as I have heard which are here allowed them), therefore they use to name a Venetian mountebank …
        [the] principal mountebank of all Italy. Neither do I much doubt but that this treatise of them will be
        acceptable to some readers, as being a mere novelty never before heard of (I think) by thousands of our English
        gallants. Surely the principal reason that hath induced me to make mention of them is because, when I was in
        Venice, they oftentimes ministered infinite pleasure unto me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will first begin with the etymology of their name: the word “mountebank” (being in the Italian tongue <span
        class="it">monta inbanco</span>) is compounded of two Italian words, <span class="it">montare</span>, which
        signifies to ascend or go up to a place, and <span class="it">banco</span>, a bench, because these fellows do
        act their part upon a stage, which is compacted of benches or forms, though I have seen some few of them also
        stand upon the ground when they tell their tales, which are such as are commonly called <span class="it">ciaratanoes</span>
        or charlatans. In Latin, they are called <span class="it">circulatores</span> and <span
        class="it">agyrtae</span>, which is derived from the Greek word <span class="it">ayelpeiv</span>, which
        signifies to gather or draw a company of people together … The principal place where they act is the first part
        of Saint Mark’s street that reaches betwixt the west front of St. Mark’s Church and the opposite front of Saint
        Geminian’s Church, in which, twice a day, that is, in the morning and in the afternoon, you may see five or six
        several [different] stages erected for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those that act upon the ground, even the forsaid “charlatans,” being of the poorer sort of them, stand most
        commonly in the second part of St. Mark’s, not far from the gate of the Duke’s Palace. These mountebanks at one
        end of their stage place their trunk, which is replenished with a world of new-fangled trumperies. After the
        whole rabble of them is gotten up to the stage, whereof some wear vizards being disguised like fools in a play;
        some that are women (for there are diverse women also amongst them) are attired with habits according to that
        person that they sustain [they wear the liveries of their patrons or patients?]. After (I say) they are all upon
        the stage, the music begins­­–sometimes vocal, sometimes instrumental, and sometimes both together. This music
        is a preamble and introduction to the ensuing matter. In the meantime, while the music plays, the principal
        mountebank, which is the captain and ringleader of all the rest, opens his trunk, and sets abroach [displays]
        his wares. After the music has ceased, he makes an oration to the audience of half an hour long, or almost an
        hour, wherein he does most hyperbolically extoll the virtue of his drugs and confections–<span class="it">Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces</span>.
        [“He praises his wares who hopes to unload them on someone else,” Horace]–though many of them are very
        counterfeit and false.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly, I often wondered at many of these natural orators. For they would tell their tales with such admirable
        volubility and plausible grace, even extempore, and seasoned with that singular variety of elegant jests and
        witty conceits, that they did often strike great admiration into strangers that never heard them before. And by
        how much the more eloquent these naturalists are, by so much the greater audience they draw unto them, and the
        more ware they sell. After the chiefest mountebank’s first speech is ended, he delivers out his commodities by
        little and little, the jester still playing his part, and the musicians singing and playing upon their
        instruments. The principal things that they sell are oils, sovereign waters, amorous songs printed, apothecary
        drugs, and a commonweal of other trifles. The head mountebank at every time that he delivers out anything, makes
        an extemporal speech, which he does eftsoons [repeatedly] intermingle with such savory jests (but spiced now and
        then with singular scurrility) that they minister passing mirth and laughter to the whole company, which perhaps
        may consist of a thousand people that flock together about one of their stages. For so many according to my
        estimation I have seen giving attention to some notable eloquent mountebank.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have observed marvelous strange matters done by some of these mountebanks. For I saw one of them hold a viper
        in his hand, and play with his sting a quarter of an hour together, and yet receive no hurt, though another man
        should have been presently stung to death with it. He made us all believe that the same viper was lineally
        descended from the generation of that viper that leapt out of the fire upon St. Paul’s hand, in the island of
        Melita now called Malta, and did him no hurt. And [he] told us moreover that it would sting some, and not
        others. Also, I have seen a mountebank hackle [hack or slash] and gash his naked arm with a knife most pitifully
        to behold, so that the blood has streamed out in great abundance, and by and by after he has applied a certain
        oil unto it, wherewith he has incontinent[ly] both stanched the blood, and so thoroughly healed the wounds and
        gashes that when he hath afterwards showed us his arm again, we could not possibly perceive the least token of a
        gash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides there was another black-gowned mountebank that gave most excellent contentment to the company that
        frequented his stage. This fellow was born blind, and so continued to that day. He never missed Saint Mark’s
        place twice a day for six weeks together. He was noted to be a singular fellow for singing extemporal songs, and
        for a pretty kind of music that he made with two bones betwixt his fingers. Moreover, I have seen some of them
        do such strange juggling tricks as would be almost incredible to be reported. Also, I have observed this in
        them, that after they have extolled their wares to the skies, having set the price of ten crowns upon someone of
        their commodities, they have at last descended so low that they have taken for it four gazets, which is
        something less than a groat. These merry fellows do most commonly continue two good hours upon the stage, and at
        last when they have fed the audience with such passing variety of sport that they are even cloyed with the
        superfluity of their conceits, and have sold as much ware as they can, they remove their trinkets and stage till
        the next meeting. Thus much concerning the mountebanks.

      The <span class="it">OED</span> defines a “toad-eater” as “one who eats toads; <span class="it">originally</span>
      the attendant of a charlatan, employed to eat or pretend to eat toads (held to be poisonous) to enable his master
      to exhibit his skill in expelling poison.” In the figure of the toad-eater, then, we find another link between the
      toad and the mountebank. In the eighteenth century, the toad-eater picks up the meaning now associated with the
      word “toady,” that is, “a fawning flatterer, parasite, sycophant.” Thus the apparently bizarre act of toad-eating
      in service to the mountebank haunts contemporary usage. The following, a diary entry about “William Utting, toad
      eater,” is the earliest text the <span class="it">OED</span> cites linking toad-eaters and charlatans, although it
      does not relate the toad-eater to a mountebank. The examples of toad-eaters working for quacks in the <span
      class="it">OED</span> are all from the eighteenth century.

        In October 1629, I having been at Wickham Market, at my cousin Games’s, with my wife and Anthony, in our return,
        about Kesgrave, between Woodbridge and Ipswich, I fell into the company of one Paine, a shopkeeper in Laxfield,
        of whom, after much talk about Mr. Skinner and my old acquaintance at Laxfield and Dennington, I inquired of him
        if William Utting the toad-eater (of whom, see in my first long notebook, covered with redder forrell [a book
        case], page 43, and in the notes of 1612)* did not once keep at Laxfield. He told me yes, and said he had seen
        him eat a toad, nay two. The man in whose house he kept went to him for his sake, and after salutation, told him
        that a friend of his would give a groat to see him eat a toad (thus was the way to see it). He accepted the
        offer, and went and fetched in, from under blocks, 2 toads, and, rubbing of the earth (as in my other book), he
        swallowed them down. But presently he cast them up into his hands, and after some pause, “Nay,” says he, “I will
        not lose my groat,” so taking that which came up last (says he), “thou went in first before and shall so do
        again.” When both then were down, his stomach held them, and he had his groat. This said Paine. See my notebook,
        what I saw, &c.
      </p>
      <div class="sidenote">*The notebooks to which Rous here refers do not seem to have survived, although we have a
        miscellany as well as his diary. But his parenthetical reference to his “first notebook” as well as “notes of
        1612,” which might or might not be part of that notebook, documents a robust, self-conscious, and
        self-referential note-taking practice.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        There was a mountebank tricked up as fine as a lord. A certain ape, that had a mind to set up for a beau [or a
        gallant], spies him out, and nothing would serve him but he must have a suit and dress after the same pattern.
        He pressed the quack so hard for it that at last he told him plainly, “Upon condition,” says he, “that you shall
        wear a silver chain about your neck, I'll give you the very fellow on [or of] it. For you’ll be running away
        with your livery [uniform] else.” Jack [the ape] agrees to it, and is presently rigged out in his gold and
        silver lace, with a feather in his cap, and as figures go now a-days, a very pretty figure he made in the world,
        I can assure you; though upon second thoughts, when the heat of the vanity was over, he grew sick of his
        bargain. For he found that he had sold his liberty for a fool’s coat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MORAL<br/>’Tis with us in our lives, as with the Indians in their trade, that truck [exchange] gold and
        pearl for beads and glasses.* We part with the blessings of both worlds for pleasures, court-favors, and
        commissions. And, at last, when we have sold ourselves to our lusts, we grow sick of our bargain.
      </p>
      <p>
        REFLECTION<br/>A vain fool can hardly be more miserable than the granting of his own prayers and wishes would
        make him. How many spectacles does every day afford us of apes and mountebanks in gay coats that pass in the
        world for philosophers, and men of honor; and it is no wonder for one fool to value himself upon the same vanity
        for which he esteems another. He that judges of men and of things by sense, governs himself by sense too. And he
        that well considers the practices and opinions of the age he lives in, will find that folly and passion have
        more disciples than wisdom and virtue. The feather in a fool’s cap is a fool’s inclination. Nay, it is his
        ambition, too. For he that measures the character of another man by his outside, seldom looks further than the
        business of dress and appearance in himself, besides [the fact] that ill examples work more upon us than good,
        and that we are forwarder to imitate the one than to emulate the other. This now is the highest pitch of
        infelicity, when we do not only square our lives in general, according to vicious precedents, but set our hearts
        in particular (with the fantastical ape here) upon this or that extravagance. No other sort of fool would
        please him, than the very counterpart of this quack. His mistake was double. First, he placed an opinion of
        happiness where there was no ground at all to expect it. Secondly, he parted with his liberty in exchange for
        it, which is the same thing with trucking the greatest blessing of human nature for the handiwork of a tailor.
      </p>
      <div class="sidenote">*This seventeenth-century summary of the story’s moral depends on the racist assumption that
        native people foolishly accepted worthless goods (beads and mirrors) in exchange for precious ones (gold and
        pearl). Widely repeated, this assumption informed contempt for native peoples and preparations for trade with
        them. For example, the records of the Virginia company document efforts to establish a glass furnace in 1621
        because “the Comoditie of Beads was like to prove the Verie Coyne of that Country” (<span class="it">The Records of the Virginia Company of London</span>,
        ed. Susan Myra Kingsbury [Washington: Government Printing Office, 1906], 1:513.) The constant repetition of this
        assumption in unexpected places, like this moral, obscures the messy facts of Anglo-Indian trade. In Virginia,
        for example, the settlers were often trading for corn, not gold, and the Indians were often trading for tools
        and guns.

        but in all the territories, that happily joy under the government<br/>
        of the most pious and magnificent states of Italy. But may some<br/>
        other gallant fellow say, O, there be divers that make profession<br/>

        very many have assayed, like apes, in imitation of that, which is<br/>
        really and essentially in me, to make of this oil; bestowed great<br/>
        cost in furnaces, stills, alembecks, continual fires, and<br/>
        preparation of the ingredients, (as indeed there goes to it six<br/>
        hundred several simples, besides some quantity of human fat, for<br/>
        the conglutination, which we buy of the anatomists,) but, when<br/>
        these practitioners come to the last decoction, blow, blow, puff,<br/>
        puff, and all flies in fumo: ha, ha, ha! Poor wretches! I rather<br/>

        money; for these may be recovered by industry: but to be a fool<br/>
        born, is a disease incurable.<br/>

        world is but as an empire, that empire as a province, that<br/>
        province as a bank, that bank as a private purse to the purchase<br/>
        of it. I will only tell you; it is the powder that made Venus a<br/>
        goddess (given her by Apollo,) that kept her perpetually young,<br/>
        clear’d her wrinkles, firm'd her gums, fill'd her skin, colour’d<br/>

      </div>
      <p>
        Gentlemen,<br/>
        Having had continual and daily experience in several parts for many years together, in the cure of the French
        Disease, with as good success as mine own heart could wish, and now at length desiring to show myself a
        profitable member of this commonwealth and city wherein I abide, I could not choose but write to you by way of
        advice, seeing so many errors among you, tending all to the destruction of the patient. In the first place, I
        counsel thee, O man or woman, whoever thou art, that does profess the cure of venereal distempers, to avoid that
        common fault among all the professors thereof, which is covetousness. For if a young man or a young woman has by
        chance got a clap, and is willing to give all he has, rather than to endure the disease long, will you be so
        base and sordid to make his or her earnest desire to be the cause of thy exaction [extortion]? Assure yourself
        that money got by such exaction will be a worm to consume that part of your estate which you have honestly got.
        In the next place, be not too inquisitive of any patient who he is and where he dwells. For if he has not a mind
        to tell you, what have you to do to enquire anything concerning him? Thirdly, judge not rashly of him, as who
        should say, “you have been lying with a wench.” For you cannot but know that there are many ways of getting
        claps beside that one, as by drinking with the party, lying in a hot bed with him, sitting upon a close-stool
        after him; as also by lifting, riding, or any other manner of straining. Then let every patient receive his cure
        with all privacy. And lastly, do not flatter me daily with any patient whatsoever. This is the part which you
        have to act upon the theatre of this world, which, if you do not justly perform, consider, I say, consider, that
        you must make your exits into stoves and sweating tubs much hotter than those with which you ever afflicted your
        patients … being on earth. Heaven direct your course, that you may be neither cheaters, imposters, nor cozeners,
        as most are who profess the cure of venereal distempers, but that you may be in this, as well as in all your
        other actions, faithful and honest; which is the daily wish of,<br/>
        Your Friend and Servant.

      Mountebanks often used public entertainments to advertise their medicines, and several seventeenth-century ballads
      take up the subject of mountebanks, painting pictures of them as lazy, itinerant swindlers best known for
      distributing poison. “The Skillful Doctor, OR The Complete Mountebank,” a ballad c. 1685-1688, mimics what a
      mountebank might call out to viewers as he went along, stressing his ability to restore women’s lost maidenheads
      (Source: Early Broadside and Ballads Archive, EBBA ID 21926, Magdalen College, Pepys Library). Like other
      itinerant workers, mountebanks were classified as threats to society: “A new merry ballad I have to show,” from
      1630, warns its listeners to stay away from Jesuits, papists, prostitutes, usurers, lawyers, courtiers, and
      mountebanks, who deceive society, cheat people of their money, and spread venereal disease (Source: Early
      Broadside and Ballads Archive, EBBA ID 20078, Magdalen College, Pepys Library). “The Miserable Mountebank,”
      another ballad c. 1685-88, depicts the sort of duel Pulter describes. In it, the skeptical plowman “Downright
      Dick” challenges the mountebank who sells a “never failing pill” that proposes to cure all diseases and raise
      “some persons from the dead,” calling him down from his stage for a parley and beating him severely. In a woodcut
      from the ballad, presented below, the mountebank promises that “here you may be cured.”

      After the Earl of Rochester accidentally gave Charles II a critical and obscene poem (“A Satyr on Charles II”) he
      had written about him in 1674, he had to stay out of the king’s way and out of court for a while. As part of his
      exile, he disguised himself as an Italian mountebank on Tower street—so successfully, it was said, that his
      friends didn’t recognize him—and actually practiced medicine for some weeks. That Rochester’s work as a mountebank
      was a performance tightens the connection of mountebanks with the theatre; his success suggests the unstable
      distinction between mountebanks and physicians. The mountebank’s pitch had become so conventional that Rochester
      could parody it. This is a broadside advertising his services.

        premeditated cheats, or at best the palpable dull and empty mistakes of their self-deluded imagination—in physic
        (chemical and Galenic), in astrology, physiognomy, palmistry, mathematics, alchemy, and even in government
        itself (the last of which I will not propose to discourse of, or meddle at all in, since it in no way belongs to
        my trade or vocation, as the rest do, which, thanks to my God, I find much more safe, I think equally honest,
        and therefore more profitable)—but as to all the former, they have been so erroneously practiced by many
        unlearned wretches, whom poverty and neediness for the most part (if not the restless itch of deceiving) has
        forced to straggle and wander in unknown parts, that even the professions themselves, though originally the
        products of the most learned and wise men's laborious studies and experience, and by them left a wealthy and
        glorious inheritance for ages to come, seem by this bastard race of quacks and cheats to have been run out of
        all wisdom, learning, perspicuousness, and truth, with which they were so plentifully stocked; and now run into
        a repute of mere mists, imaginations, errors, and deceits, such as in the management of these idle professors
        indeed they were. … But that I may not prove too tedious, I will proceed faithfully to inform you, what are the
        things in which I pretend chiefly at this time to serve my country.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I will (by the leave of God) perfectly cure that <span class="it">Labes Britannica</span>, or grand
        English disease, the scurvy, and that with such ease to my patient, that he shall not be sensible of the least
        inconvenience whilst I steal his distemper from him. I know there are many, who treat this disease with mercury,
        antimony, spirits, and salts, being dangerous remedies, in which I shall meddle very little, and with great
        caution, but by more secure, gentle, and less fallible medicines, together with the observation of some few
        rules in diet, perfectly cure the patient, having freed him from all the symptoms, as looseness of the teeth,
        scorbutic spots [spots that are a symptom of scurvy], want of appetite, pains and lassitude in the limbs and
        joints, especially the legs. And to say truth, there are few distempers in this nation that are not, or at least
        proceed not originally from the scurvy, which were it well rooted out (as I make no question to do it from all
        those who shall come into my hands) there would not be heard of so many gouts, aches, dropsies, and
        consumptions. Nay, even those thick and slimy humors which generate stones in the kidneys and bladder are for
        the most part offsprings of the scurvy. It would prove tedious to set down all its malignant race; but those who
        address themselves here, shall be still informed by me in the nature of their distempers, and the grounds I
        proceed upon to their cure. So will all reasonable people be satisfied that I treat them with care, honesty, and
        understanding. For I am not of their opinion who endeavor to render their vocations rather mysterious, than
        useful and satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will not here make a catalogue of diseases and distempers. It behooves a physician I am sure to understand
        them all. But if any come to me (as I think there are very few that have escaped my practice), I shall not be
        ashamed to own to my patient where I find myself to seek [that is, uncertain], and at least he shall be secure
        with me from having experiments tried upon him, a privilege he can never hope to enjoy, either in the hands of
        the grand doctors of the court and town, or in those of the lesser quacks and mountebanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is fit, though, that I assure you of great secrecy as well as care in diseases, where it is requisite,
        whether venereal or others, as some peculiar to women, the green sickness [a disease associated with virgins,
        for which the cure prescribed was often sexual intercourse], weaknesses, inflammations, or obstructions in the
        stomach, reins [kidneys], liver, spleen, &c. For I would put no word in my bill that bears any unclean sound. It
        is enough that I make myself understood. I have seen physician’s bills as bawdy as Aretino’s <span class="it">Dialogues</span>*
        (which no man that walks warily before God can approve of) but I cure all suffocations in those parts producing
        fits of the mother [disorders of the uterus, especially a supposed condition by which the uterus rose in the
        body so as to suffocate], convulsions, nocturnal inquietudes, and other strange accidents not fit to be set down
        here, persuading young women very often that their hearts are like to break for love, when God knows the
        distemper lies far enough from that place.
      </p>
      <div class="sidenote">Pietro Aretino’s <span class="it">Dialogues</span> was a bawdy and hugely popular
        sixteenth-century text, first published in Italian.
      </div>
      <p>
        Likewise barrenness proceeding from any accidental cause, as it often falls out, and no natural defect, for
        nature is easily assisted, difficultly [sic] restored, but impossible to be made more perfect by man than God
        himself had at first created and bestowed it. Cures of this kind I have done signal and many, for the which I
        doubt not but I have the good wishes and hearty prayers of many families, who had else pined out their days
        under the deplorable and reproachful misfortunes of barren wombs, leaving plentiful estates and possessions to
        be inherited by strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to astrological predictions, physiognomy, divination by dreams, and otherwise (palmistry I have not faith in,
        because there can be no reason alleged for it), my own experience has convinced me more of their considerable
        effects and marvelous operations, chiefly in the directions of future proceedings, to the avoiding of dangers
        that threaten, and laying hold of advantages that might offer themselves. I say, my own practice has convinced
        me more than all the sage and wise writings extant of those matters. For I might say this for myself (did it not
        look like ostentation) that I have very seldom failed in my predictions, and often been very serviceable in my
        advice. How far I am capable in this way I am sure is not fit to be delivered in print. Those who have no
        opinion of the truth of this art, will not, I suppose, come to me about it. Such as have, I make no question of
        giving them ample satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor will I be ashamed to set down here my willingness to practice rare secrets (though somewhat collateral to my
        profession), for the help, conservation, and augmentation of beauty and comeliness, a thing created at first by
        God, chiefly for the glory of his own name, and then for the better establishment of mutual love between man and
        woman. For when God had bestowed on man the power of strength and wisdom, and thereby rendered woman liable to
        the subjection of his absolute will, it seemed but requisite that she should be endowed likewise in recompense,
        with some quality that might beget in him admiration of her, and so enforce his tenderness and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The knowledge of these secrets I gathered in my travels abroad (where I have spent my time ever since I was
        fifteen years old to this my nine and twentieth year) in France and Italy. Those that have travelled in Italy
        will tell you to what a miracle art does there assist nature in the preservation of beauty; how women of forty
        bear the same countenance with those of fifteen. Ages are no ways there distinguished by faces, whereas here in
        England, look a horse in the mouth, and a woman in the face, you presently know both their ages to a year. I
        will therefore give you such remedies, that without destroying your complexion (as most of your paints and
        daubings do) shall render them perfectly fair, clearing and preserving them from all spots, freckles, heats, and
        pimples, nay, marks of the small-pox, or any other accidental ones, so the face be not seamed or scarred.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also cleanse and preserve your teeth white and round as pearls, fastening them that are loose; your gums
        shall be kept entire, and red as coral; your lips of the same color, and soft as you could wish your lawful
        kisses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will likewise administer that which shall cure the worst breath, provided the lungs be not totally perished
        and impostumated [infected], as also certain and infallible remedies for those whose breaths are yet untainted,
        so that nothing but either a very long sickness or old age itself shall ever be able to spoil them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will, besides (if it be desired) take away from their fatness who have overmuch, and add flesh to those that
        want it, without the least detriment to their constitutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now should Galen himself look out of his grave, and tell me these were baubles below the profession of a
        physician, I would boldly answer him, that I take more glory in preserving God’s image, in its unblemished
        beauty upon one good face, than I should do in patching up all the decayed carcasses in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        They that will do me the favor to come to me, shall be sure from three of the clock in the afternoon till eight
        at night at my lodgings in Tower-street, next door to the sign of the Black Swan, at a goldsmith's house to find

      Edward Coke’s presentation of the Jacobean witchcraft statute (I Jac. cap. 12), includes this discussion of
      punishments for those who fall short of bringing about death, but are found guilty of the second degree felony of
      using enchantment or charms to locate treasure, find lost or stolen items, provoke to unlawful love, destroy
      property, or intend but not effect harm to persons. Coke warns that “diverse impostors, men and women, would take
      upon them to tell, or do these five things here specified, in great deceit of the people, and cheating and
      cozening them of their money or other goods.”

        Here are expressed the punishments inflicted upon these impostors, mountebanks, and cheating quacksalvers, viz.
        1. To suffer imprisonment by the space of a whole year without bail or mainprize. 2. Once every quarter of the
        year these mountebanks are to mount the pillory, and to stand thereupon in some market town six hours, and there
        to confess his or her error, and offence.

      printing and distributing unlicensed books, among other things. Lilburne’s punishment included imprisonment,
      whipping, gagging and being set in the pillory.
