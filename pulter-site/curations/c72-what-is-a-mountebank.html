  While mountebanks are usually defined as crooks and imposters who trade in false promises and claim knowledge they don’t have, in the seventeenth century it was not always easy to distinguish them from other medical practitioners or from other entertainers and orators.

  <p>
    I hope it will not be esteemed for an impertinency to my discourse, if I next speak of the mountebanks of Venice, seeing amongst many other things that doe much famous this city [make this city famous], these two sorts of people, namely the courtesans [whom he has just discussed at length] and the mountebanks, are not the least. For although there are mountebanks also in other cities of Italy, yet because there is a greater concourse of them in Venice than elsewhere, and that of the better sort and the most eloquent fellows, and also for that there is a larger toleration of them here than in other cities (for in Rome, etc. they are restrained from certain matters as I have heard which are here allowed them), therefore they use to name a Venetian mountebank … [the] principal mountebank of all Italy. Neither do I much doubt but that this treatise of them will be acceptable to some readers, as being a mere novelty never before heard of (I think) by thousands of our English gallants. Surely the principal reason that hath induced me to make mention of them is because, when I was in Venice, they oftentimes ministered infinite pleasure unto me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will first begin with the etymology of their name: the word “mountebank” (being in the Italian tongue <span class="it">monta inbanco</span>) is compounded of two Italian words, <span class="it">montare</span>, which signifies to ascend or go up to a place, and <span class="it">banco</span>, a bench, because these fellows do act their part upon a stage, which is compacted of benches or forms, though I have seen some few of them also stand upon the ground when they tell their tales, which are such as are commonly called <span class="it">ciaratanoes</span> or charlatans. In Latin, they are called <span class="it">circulatores</span> and <span class="it">agyrtae</span>, which is derived from the Greek word <span class="it">ayelpeiv</span>, which signifies to gather or draw a company of people together … The principal place where they act is the first part of Saint Mark’s street that reaches betwixt the west front of St. Mark’s Church and the opposite front of Saint Geminian’s Church, in which, twice a day, that is, in the morning and in the afternoon, you may see five or six several [different] stages erected for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those that act upon the ground, even the forsaid “charlatans,” being of the poorer sort of them, stand most commonly in the second part of St. Mark’s, not far from the gate of the Duke’s Palace. These mountebanks at one end of their stage place their trunk, which is replenished with a world of new-fangled trumperies. After the whole rabble of them is gotten up to the stage, whereof some wear vizards being disguised like fools in a play; some that are women (for there are diverse women also amongst them) are attired with habits according to that person that they sustain [they wear the liveries of their patrons or patients?]. After (I say) they are all upon the stage, the music begins­­––sometimes vocal, sometimes instrumental, and sometimes both together. This music is a preamble and introduction to the ensuing matter. In the meantime, while the music plays, the principal mountebank, which is the captain and ringleader of all the rest, opens his trunk, and sets abroach [displays] his wares. After the music has ceased, he makes an oration to the audience of half an hour long, or almost an hour, wherein he does most hyperbolically extoll the virtue of his drugs and confections–<span class="it">Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces</span>. [“He praises his wares who hopes to unload them on someone else,” Horace]––though many of them are very counterfeit and false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Truly, I often wondered at many of these natural orators. For they would tell their tales with such admirable volubility and plausible grace, even extempore, and seasoned with that singular variety of elegant jests and witty conceits, that they did often strike great admiration into strangers that never heard them before. And by how much the more eloquent these naturalists are, by so much the greater audience they draw unto them, and the more ware they sell. After the chiefest mountebank’s first speech is ended, he delivers out his commodities by little and little, the jester still playing his part, and the musicians singing and playing upon their instruments. The principal things that they sell are oils, sovereign waters, amorous songs printed, apothecary drugs, and a commonweal of other trifles. The head mountebank at every time that he delivers out anything, makes an extemporal speech, which he does eftsoons [repeatedly] intermingle with such savory jests (but spiced now and then with singular scurrility) that they minister passing mirth and laughter to the whole company, which perhaps may consist of a thousand people that flock together about one of their stages. For so many according to my estimation I have seen giving attention to some notable eloquent mountebank.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have observed marvelous strange matters done by some of these mountebanks. For I saw one of them hold a viper in his hand, and play with his sting a quarter of an hour together, and yet receive no hurt, though another man should have been presently stung to death with it. He made us all believe that the same viper was lineally descended from the generation of that viper that leapt out of the fire upon St. Paul’s hand, in the island of Melita now called Malta, and did him no hurt. And [he] told us moreover that it would sting some, and not others. Also, I have seen a mountebank hackle [hack or slash] and gash his naked arm with a knife most pitifully to behold, so that the blood has streamed out in great abundance, and by and by after he has applied a certain oil unto it, wherewith he has incontinent[ly] both stanched the blood, and so thoroughly healed the wounds and gashes that when he hath afterwards showed us his arm again, we could not possibly perceive the least token of a gash.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides there was another black-gowned mountebank that gave most excellent contentment to the company that frequented his stage. This fellow was born blind, and so continued to that day. He never missed Saint Mark’s place twice a day for six weeks together. He was noted to be a singular fellow for singing extemporal songs, and for a pretty kind of music that he made with two bones betwixt his fingers. Moreover, I have seen some of them do such strange juggling tricks as would be almost incredible to be reported. Also, I have observed this in them, that after they have extolled their wares to the skies, having set the price of ten crowns upon someone of their commodities, they have at last descended so low that they have taken for it four gazets, which is something less than a groat. These merry fellows do most commonly continue two good hours upon the stage, and at last when they have fed the audience with such passing variety of sport that they are even cloyed with the superfluity of their conceits, and have sold as much ware as they can, they remove their trinkets and stage till the next meeting. Thus much concerning the mountebanks.

  The <span class="it">OED</span> defines a “toad-eater” as “one who eats toads; <span class="it">originally</span> the attendant of a charlatan, employed to eat or pretend to eat toads (held to be poisonous) to enable his master to exhibit his skill in expelling poison.” In the figure of the toad-eater, then, we find another link between the toad and the mountebank. In the eighteenth century, the toad-eater picks up the meaning now associated with the word “toady,” that is, “a fawning flatterer, parasite, sycophant.” Thus the apparently bizarre act of toad-eating in service to the mountebank haunts contemporary usage. The following, a diary entry about “William Utting, toad eater,”  is the earliest text the <span class="it">OED</span> cites linking toad-eaters and charlatans, although it does not relate the toad-eater to a mountebank. The examples of toad-eaters working for quacks in the <span class="it">OED</span> are all from the eighteenth century.

  <p>
    In October 1629, I having been at Wickham Market, at my cousin Games’s, with my wife and Anthony, in our return, about Kesgrave, between Woodbridge and Ipswich, I fell into the company of one Paine, a shopkeeper in Laxfield, of whom, after much talk about Mr. Skinner and my old acquaintance at Laxfield and Dennington, I inquired of him if William Utting the toad-eater (of whom, see in my first long notebook, covered with redder forrell [a book case], page 43, and in the notes of 1612)* did not once keep at Laxfield. He told me yes, and said he had seen him eat a toad, nay two. The man in whose house he kept went to him for his sake, and after salutation, told him that a friend of his would give a groat to see him eat a toad (thus was the way to see it). He accepted the offer, and went and fetched in, from under blocks, 2 toads, and, rubbing of the earth (as in my other book), he swallowed them down. But presently he cast them up into his hands, and after some pause, “Nay,” says he, “I will not lose my groat,” so taking that which came up last (says he), “thou went in first before and shall so do again.” When both then were down, his stomach held them, and he had his groat. This said Paine. See my notebook, what I saw, &c.”
  </p>
  <div class="sidenote">*The notebooks to which Rous here refers do not seem to have survived, although we have a miscellany as well as his diary. But his parenthetical reference to his “first notebook” as well as “notes of 1612,” which might or might not be part of that notebook, documents a robust, self-conscious, and self-referential note-taking practice.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    There was a mountebank tricked up as fine as a lord. A certain ape, that had a mind to set up for a beau [or a gallant], spies him out, and nothing would serve him but he must have a suit and dress after the same pattern. He pressed the quack so hard for it that at last he told him plainly, “Upon condition,” says he, “that you shall wear a silver chain about your neck, I'll give you the very fellow on [or of] it. For you’ll be running away with your livery [uniform] else.” Jack [the ape] agrees to it, and is presently rigged out in his gold and silver lace, with a feather in his  cap, and as figures go now a-days, a very pretty figure he made in the world, I can assure you; though upon second thoughts, when the heat of the vanity was over, he grew sick of his bargain. For he found that he had sold his liberty for a fool’s coat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The MORAL<br/>’Tis with us in our lives, as with the Indians in their trade, that truck [exchange] gold and pearl for beads and glasses.* We part with the blessings of both worlds for pleasures, court-favors, and commissions. And, at last, when we have sold ourselves to our lusts, we grow sick of our bargain.
  </p>
  <p>
    REFLECTION<br/>A vain fool can hardly be more miserable than the granting of his own prayers and wishes would make him. How many spectacles does every day afford us of apes and mountebanks in gay coats that pass in the world for philosophers, and men of honor; and it is no wonder for one fool to value himself upon the same vanity for which he esteems another. He that judges of men and of things by sense, governs himself by sense too. And he that well considers the practices and opinions of the age he lives in, will find that folly and passion have more disciples than wisdom and virtue. The feather in a fool’s cap is a fool’s inclination. Nay, it is his ambition, too. For he that measures the character of another man by his outside, seldom looks further than the business of dress and appearance in himself, besides [the fact] that ill examples work more upon us than good, and that we are forwarder to imitate the one than to emulate the other. This now is the highest pitch of infelicity, when we do not only square our lives in general, according to vicious presidents, but set our hearts in particular (with the fantastical ape here,) upon this or that extravagance. No other sort of fool would please him, than the very counterpart of this quack. His mistake was double. First, he placed an opinion of happiness where there was no ground at all to expect it. Secondly, he parted with his liberty in exchange for it, which is the same thing with trucking the greatest blessing of human nature for the handiwork of a tailor.
</p>
<div class="sidenote">*This seventeenth-century summary of the story’s moral depends on the racist assumption that native people foolishly accepted worthless goods (beads and mirrors) in exchange for precious ones (gold and pearl). Widely repeated, this assumption informed contempt for native peoples and preparations for trade with them. For example, the records of the Virginia company document efforts to establish a glass furnace in 1621 because “the Comoditie of Beads was like to prove the Verie Coyne of that Country” (<span class="it">The Records of the Virginia Company of London</span>, ed. Susan Myra Kingsbury [Washington:  Government Printing Office, 1906], 1:513. The constant repetition of this assumption in unexpected places, like this moral, obscures the messy facts of Anglo-Indian trade. In Virginia, for example, the settlers were often trading for corn, not gold, and the Indians were often trading for tools and guns.</div>

     Great general scholars, excellent physicians,<br/>
     Most admired statesmen, profest favourites,<br/>
     And cabinet counsellors to the greatest princes;<br/>

    my bank in face of the public Piazza, near the shelter of the<br/>
    Portico to the Procuratia, should now, after eight months’<br/>

 poisoning the cardinal Bembo’s–cook, hath at all attached,<br/>
 much less dejected me. No, no, worthy gentlemen; to tell you<br/>
 true, I cannot endure to see the rabble of these ground<br/>
 ciarlitani, that spread their cloaks on the pavement, as if<br/>
 they meant to do feats of activity, and then come in lamely,<br/>
 with their mouldy tales out of Boccacio, like stale Tabarine,<br/>
 the fabulist: some of them discoursing their travels, and of<br/>
 their tedious captivity in the Turks’ galleys, when, indeed,<br/>
 were the truth known, they were the Christians’ galleys, where<br/>

     twenty a week, and play; yet, these meagre, starved spirits,<br/>
     who have half stopt the organs of their minds with earthy<br/>
     oppilations, want not their favourers among your shrivell'd<br/>

     secrets, not only to disperse them publicly in this famous city,<br/>
     but in all the territories, that happily joy under the government<br/>
     of the most pious and magnificent states of Italy. But may some<br/>
     other gallant fellow say, O, there be divers that make profession<br/>
     to have as good, and as experimented receipts as yours: indeed,<br/>
     very many have assayed, like apes, in imitation of that, which is<br/>
     really and essentially in me, to make of this oil; bestowed great<br/>
     cost in furnaces, stills, alembecks, continual fires, and<br/>
     preparation of the ingredients, (as indeed there goes to it six<br/>
     hundred several simples, besides some quantity of human fat, for<br/>
     the conglutination, which we buy of the anatomists,) but, when<br/>
     these practitioners come to the last decoction, blow, blow, puff,<br/>
     puff, and all flies in fumo: ha, ha, ha! Poor wretches! I rather<br/>
     pity their folly and indiscretion, than their loss of time and<br/>
     money; for these may be recovered by industry: but to be a fool<br/>
     born, is a disease incurable.<br/>
     For myself, I always from my youth have endeavoured to get the<br/>
     rarest secrets, and book them, either in exchange, or for money;<br/>
     I spared nor cost nor labour, where anything was worthy to be<br/>
     learned. And gentlemen, honourable gentlemen, I will undertake,<br/>
     by virtue of chemical art, out of the honourable hat that covers<br/>
     your head, to extract the four elements; that is to say, the<br/>
     fire, air, water, and earth, and return you your felt without<br/>
     burn or stain. For, whilst others have been at the Balloo, I<br/>
     have been at my book; and am now past the craggy paths of study,<br/>
     and come to the flowery plains of honour and reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
    SIR P: I do assure you, sir, that is his aim.
  </p>
  <p>
    VOLP: But, to our price–
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: And that withal, sir Pol.
  </p>
  <p>
    VOLP: You all know, honourable gentlemen, I never valued this<br/>
     ampulla, or vial, at less than eight crowns, but for this time,<br/>
     I am content, to be deprived of it for six; six crowns is the<br/>
     price; and less, in courtesy I know you cannot offer me; take it,<br/>
     or leave it, howsoever, both it and I am at your service. I ask<br/>
     you not as the value of the thing, for then I should demand of<br/>
     you a thousand crowns, so the cardinals Montalto, Fernese, the<br/>
     great Duke of Tuscany, my gossip, with divers other princes, have<br/>
     given me; but I despise money. Only to shew my affection to you,<br/>
     honourable gentlemen, and your illustrious State here, I have<br/>
     neglected the messages of these princes, mine own offices,<br/>
     framed my journey hither, only to present you with the fruits of<br/>
     my travels.–Tune your voices once more to the touch of your<br/>
     instruments, and give the honourable assembly some delightful<br/>
     recreation.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: What monstrous and most painful circumstance<br/>
     Is here, to get some three or four gazettes,<br/>
     Some three-pence in the whole! for that ’twill come to.
  </p>
  <p>
    NANO [SINGS.]: You that would last long, list to my song,<br/>
     Make no more coil, but buy of this oil.<br/>
     Would you be ever fair and young?<br/>
     Stout of teeth, and strong of tongue?<br/>
     Tart of palate? quick of ear?<br/>
     Sharp of sight? of nostril clear?<br/>
     Moist of hand? and light of foot?<br/>
     Or, I will come nearer to’t,<br/>
     Would you live free from all diseases?<br/>
     Do the act your mistress pleases;<br/>
     Yet fright all aches from your bones?<br/>
     Here’s a med’cine, for the nones.
  </p>
  <p>
    VOLP: Well, I am in a humour at this time to make a present of<br/>
     the small quantity my coffer contains; to the rich, in<br/>
     courtesy, and to the poor for God’s sake. Wherefore now mark:<br/>
     I ask’d you six crowns, and six crowns, at other times, you<br/>
     have paid me; you shall not give me six crowns, nor five, nor<br/>
     four, nor three, nor two, nor one; nor half a ducat; no, nor a<br/>
     moccinigo. Sixpence it will cost you, or six hundred pound–<br/>
     expect no lower price, for, by the banner of my front, I will<br/>
     not bate a bagatine, that I will have, only, a pledge of your<br/>
     loves, to carry something from amongst you, to shew I am not<br/>
     contemn’d by you. Therefore, now, toss your handkerchiefs,<br/>
     cheerfully, cheerfully; and be advertised, that the first<br/>
     heroic spirit that deignes to grace me with a handkerchief, I<br/>
     will give it a little remembrance of something, beside, shall<br/>
     please it better, than if I had presented it with a double<br/>
     pistolet.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: Will you be that heroic spark, sir Pol?<br/>
     [CELIA AT A WINDOW ABOVE, THROWS DOWN HER HANDKERCHIEF.]<br/>
     O see! the window has prevented you.
  </p>
  <p>
    VOLP: Lady, I kiss your bounty; and for this timely grace you<br/>
     have done your poor Scoto of Mantua, I will return you, over and<br/>
     above my oil, a secret of that high and inestimable nature,<br/>
     shall make you for ever enamour'd on that minute, wherein your<br/>
     eye first descended on so mean, yet not altogether to be<br/>
     despised, an object. Here is a powder conceal’d in this paper,<br/>
     of which, if I should speak to the worth, nine thousand volumes<br/>
     were but as one page, that page as a line, that line as a word;<br/>
     so short is this pilgrimage of man (which some call life) to the<br/>
     expressing of it. Would I reflect on the price? Why, the whole<br/>
     world is but as an empire, that empire as a province, that<br/>
     province as a bank, that bank as a private purse to the purchase<br/>
     of it. I will only tell you; it is the powder that made Venus a<br/>
     goddess (given her by Apollo,) that kept her perpetually young,<br/>
     clear’d her wrinkles, firm'd her gums, fill'd her skin, colour’d<br/>
     her hair; from her deriv’d to Helen, and at the sack of Troy<br/>
     unfortunately lost: till now, in this our age, it was as happily<br/>
     recovered, by a studious antiquary, out of some ruins of Asia,<br/>
     who sent a moiety of it to the court of France, (but much<br/>
     sophisticated,) wherewith the ladies there, now, colour their<br/>
     hair. The rest, at this present, remains with me; extracted to a<br/>
     quintessence: so that, whereever it but touches, in youth it<br/>
     perpetually preserves, in age restores the complexion; seats your<br/>
     teeth, did they dance like virginal jacks, firm as a wall; makes<br/>
     them white as ivory, that were black, as–
  </p>
  <p>
     [ENTER CORVINO.]
  </p>
  <p>
    COR: Spight o’ the devil, and my shame! come down here;<br/>
     Come down;–No house but mine to make your scene?<br/>
     Signior Flaminio, will you down, sir? down?<br/>
     What, is my wife your Franciscina, sir?<br/>
     No windows on the whole Piazza, here,<br/>
     To make your properties, but mine? but mine?<br/>
     [BEATS AWAY VOLPONE, NANO, ETC.]<br/>
     Heart! ere to-morrow, I shall be new-christen’d,<br/>
     And call’d the Pantalone di Besogniosi,<br/>
     About the town.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: What should this mean, sir Pol?
  </p>
  <p>
    SIR P: Some trick of state, believe it. I will home.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: It may be some design on you:
  </p>
  <p>
    SIR P: I know not.<br/>
     I'll stand upon my guard.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: It is your best, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    SIR P: This three weeks, all my advices, all my letters,<br/>
     They have been intercepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: Indeed, sir!<br/>
     Best have a care.
  </p>
  <p>
     SIR P: Nay, so I will.
  </p>
  <p>
    PER: This knight,<br/>
     I may not lose him, for my mirth, till night.
