      This passage, presented here in two Renaissance translations, describes what happens after the Deucalion flood.

        <li class="l">The lusty earth of own accord soon after forth did bring,</li>

        <li class="l">As soon as that the moisture once caught heat against the sun,</li>
        <li class="l">And that the fat and slimy mud in moorish [spongy or damp] grounds begun</li>
        <li class="l">To swell through warmth of Phoebus’ beams, and that the fruitful seed</li>
        <li class="l">Of things well cherished in the fat and lively soil indeed,</li>
        <li class="l">As in their mother’s womb, began in length of time to grow,</li>
        <li class="l">To one or other kind of shape wherein themselves to show.</li>
        <li class="l">So likewise when the seven-mouthed Nile the watery fields forsook,</li>
        <li class="l">And to his ancient channel oft his bridled streams betook,</li>
        <li class="l">So that the sun did heat the mud the which he left behind,</li>
        <li class="l">The husbandmen that till the ground among the clods did find</li>
        <li class="l">Of sundry creatures sundry shapes, of which they spied some</li>
        <li class="l">Even in the instant of their birth but newly then begun,</li>
        <li class="l">And some unperfect, wanting breast or shoulder in such wise,</li>
        <li class="l">That in one body oftentimes appeared to their eyes</li>
        <li class="l">One half thereof alive to be, and all the rest beside</li>
        <li class="l">Both void of life and seemly shape, stark earth to still abide.</li>
        <li class="l">For when that moisture with the heat is tempered equally,</li>
        <li class="l">They straight conceive; and of them twain engender by and by</li>
        <li class="l">All kind of thing. For though that fire with water ay [always] debateth,</li>
        <li class="l">Yet moisture mixed with equal heat all living things createth.</li>
        <li class="l">And so those discords in their kind, one striving with the other,</li>
        <li class="l">In generation do agree and make one perfect mother.</li>
        <li class="l">And therefore when the miry earth bespread with slimy mud,</li>
        <li class="l">Brought over all but late before by violence of the flood,</li>
        <li class="l">Caught heat by warmness of the sun and calmness of the sky,</li>
        <li class="l">Things out of number in the world, forthwith it did supply,</li>
        <li class="l">Whereof in part the like before in former times had been,</li>
        <li class="l">And some so strange and ugly shapes as never erst were seen.</li>
        <li class="l">In that she did such monsters breed was greatly to her woe,</li>
        <li class="l">But yet, thou, ugly python, was engendered by her, though,</li>
        <li class="l">A terror to the newmade folk, which never erst had known,</li>
        <li class="l">So foul a dragon in their life, so monstrously forgrown [overgrown].</li>

      <p>
        The earth follows next: unto which alone, of all parts of the world, for her singular benefits we have given the
        reverent and worshipful name of “mother.” For like as the heaven is the mother of God, even so is she of men.
        She it is that takes us when we are coming into the world, nourishes us when we are newborn, and, once being
        come abroad, ever sustains and bears us up. And at the last when we are rejected and forlorn of all the world
        besides, she embraces us. Then, most of all other times, like a kind mother she covers us all over in her bosom,
        by no merit more sacred than by it wherewith she makes us holy and sacred, even bearing our tombs, monuments,
        and titles, continuing our name, and extending our memory, thereby to make recompense and weigh against the
        shortness of our age. Whose last power we in our anger wish to be heavy unto our enemy, and yet she is heavy to
        none, as if we were ignorant that she alone is never angry with any man. Waters ascend up, and turn into clouds;
        they congeal and harden into hail. Swell they do into waves and billows, and down they hasten headlong into
        brooks and land floods. The air is thickened with clouds, and rages with winds and storms. But she is bountiful,
        mild, tender over us and indulgent, ready at all times to attend and wait upon the good of mortal men. See what
        she breeds being forced–nay, what she yields of her own accord! What odoriferous smells, and pleasant savors!
        What wholesome juices and liquors; what soft things to content our feeling; what lovely colors doth she give to
        please our eye! How faithfully and justly doth she repay with usury that which was lent and credited out unto
        her! Finally, what store of all things does she seed and nourish for our sake!
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas poor wretch, pestiferous and hurtful creatures, when the vital breath of the air was to blame to give them
        life, she could not otherwise choose but receive them. But in that they proved afterwards bad and venomous, the
        fault was to be laid upon the parents that engendered them, and not to be imputed unto her. For she entertains
        no more a venomous serpent after it hath stung a man. Nay, more than that, she requires punishment for them that
        are slow and negligent of themselves to seek it. She it is that brings forth medicinal herbs, and evermore is in
        travail [labor] to be delivered of something or other good for man. Over and besides, it may be thought and
        believed that for very pity of us she ordained and appointed some poisons, that when we were weary of our life,
        cursed famine (most adverse and cross of all other to the merits of the earth) should not consume and waste us
        with languishing and pining consumption, and so procure our death; that high and steep rocks should not dash and
        crush our bodies in pieces; nor the overthwart and preposterous punishment by the halter wreath our necks and
        stop that vital breath which we seek to let out and be rid of; last of all, that we might not work our own death
        in the deep sea, and being drowned, feed fishes, and be buried in their bellies, nor yet the edge and point of
        the sword cut and pierce our body, and so put us to dolorous pain. So that it is no doubt, but in a pitiful
        regard and compassion of us, she has engendered that poison by one gentle draught whereof, going most easily
        down, we might forgo our life, and die without any hurt and skin broken of our body, yea, and diminish not one
        drop of blood–without grievous pain, I say, and like only to them who be athirst, that being in that manner
        dead, neither foul of the air, nor wild beast prey upon or touch our bodies, but that he should be reserved for
        the earth, who perished by himself and for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, to confess and say the truth, the earth has bred the remedy of all miseries, howsoever we have made it a
        venom and poison to our life. For after the like sort, we employ iron and steel, which we cannot possibly be
        without. And yet we should not do well and justly to complain, in case she had brought it forth for to do hurt
        and mischief. Now surely to this only part of nature and the world we are unthankful, as though she served not
        man’s turn for all dainties, not for contumely and reproach to be misused. Cast she is into the sea, or else to
        let in peers and friths [trickles and estuaries], eaten away with water. With iron tools, with wood, fire,
        stone, burdens of corn tormented she is every hour. And all this much more to content our pleasures and wanton
        delights than to serve us with natural food and necessary nourishment. And yet, these misusages which she abides
        above and in her outward skin may seem in some sort tolerable. But we, not satisfied therewith, pierce deeper
        and enter into her very bowels. We search into the veins of gold and silver; we mine and dig for copper and lead
        metals. And for to seek out gems and some little stones, we sink pits deep within the ground. Thus, we pluck the
        very heart-strings out of her, and all to wear on our finger one gem or precious stone, to fulfill our pleasure
        and desire. How many hands are worn with digging and delving, that one joint of our finger might shine again.
        Surely, if there were any devils or infernal spirits beneath, ere this time verily these mines (for to seed
        covetousness and riot) would have brought them up above ground. Marvel we then, if she had brought forth some
        things hurtful and noisome? But savage beasts (I well think) ward and save her; they keep sacrilegious hands
        from doing her injury. Nay iwis [truly] it is nothing so. Dig we not among dragons and serpents? And together
        with veins of gold, handle we not the roots of poisonous and venomous herbs? Howbeit, this goddess we find the
        better apayed [satisfied] and less discontented for all this misusage, for that the end and issue of all this
        wealth tends to wickedness, to murder and wars, and her whom we drench with our blood, we cover also with
        unburied bones. Which nevertheless, as if she did reprove and reproach us for this rage and fury of ours, she
        herself covers in the end, and hides close even the wicked parts of mortal men. Among other imputations of an
        unthankful mind, I may well count this also, that we be ignorant of her nature.
