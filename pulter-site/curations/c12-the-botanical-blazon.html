                <p>The blazon often described beauty in botanical terms. See the Exploration <a href="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/#hester-pulter-and-english-blazon" target="_blank">“Hester Pulter and the Blazon in Early Modern England.”</a> There you will find Edmund Spenser’s Sonnet 64, which might be seen as a version of the botanical blazon, describing the beloved as a garden of flowers. Here I include two lesser known versions of the botanical blazon, one by Margaret Cavendish and one that appears as part of a text in praise of a dead virgin. We might also note that the flowers in Pulter’s “The Garden” offer a kind of blazon of human women by boasting the skin that resembles their hue, the cheeks that blush like them, the eyes and noses they please, and the breasts between which they nestle.</p>

                        <li class="l">And pastures of green hops, wherein cows went,</li>
                        <li class="l">Of probability give milk of sweet content.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some fields, though plowed with care, unsowed did lie,</li>
                        <li class="l">Wanting the fruitful seed, industry.</li>
                        <li class="l">In other fields full crops of joys there growed,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where some ripe joys fruition down had mowed.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some blasted with ill accidents looked black,</li>
                        <li class="l">Others, blown down with sorrow strong, lay flat.</li>

                        <li class="l">Then did I view enclosures close to lie,</li>

                        <li class="l">Fresh meadow of green youth did pleasant seem,</li>
                        <li class="l">Innocency, as cowslips, grew therein.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some ready with old age to cut for hay,</li>

                        <li class="l">Clear rivulets of health ran here and there,</li>
                        <li class="l">No mind of sickness in them did appear,</li>
                        <li class="l">No stones or gravel stopped their passage free;</li>
                        <li class="l">No weeds of pain or slimy gouts could see.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <ul class="lg">
                        <li class="l">Woods did present my view on the left side,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where trees of high ambition grew great pride.</li>
                        <li class="l">There shades of envy were made of dark spite,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which did eclipse the fame of honor’s light.</li>
                        <li class="l">Faults stood so close, not many beams of praise</li>
                        <li class="l">Could enter in; spite stopped up all the ways.</li>
                        <li class="l">But leaves of pratling tongues, which ne’er lie still,</li>
                        <li class="l">Sometimes speak truth, although most lies they tell.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <ul class="lg">
                        <li class="l">Then did I a garden of beauty view,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where complexions of roses and lilies grew,</li>
                        <li class="l">And violets of blue veins there growed,</li>
                        <li class="l">Upon the banks of breasts most perfect showed.</li>
                        <li class="l">Lips of fresh gillyflowers grew up high,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which oft the sun did kiss as he passed by.</li>
                        <li class="l">Hands of narcissus, perfect white were set,</li>
                        <li class="l">The palms were curious tulips, finely streaked.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <ul class="lg">
                        <li class="l">And by this garden a lovely orchard stood,</li>
                        <li class="l">Wherein grew fruit of pleasure rare, and good.</li>
                        <li class="l">All colored eyes grew there, as bullace* gray,<div class="sidenote">*plum</div></li>
                        <li class="l">And damsons black, which do taste best, some say.</li>
                        <li class="l">Others there were of the pure bluest grape,</li>
                        <li class="l">And pear-plum faces, of an oval shape,</li>
                        <li class="l">Cheeks of apricots, made red with heat,</li>
                        <li class="l">And cherry lips, which most delight to eat.</li>
                        <li class="l">When I had viewed this landscape round about,</li>
                        <li class="l">I fell from fancy’s hill, and so wit’s sight went out.</li>

                    <li class="l">Peer out like alabaster rocks.</li>
                    <li class="l">From her black jetty starry eye,</li>

                    <li class="l">Brave gen’rous spirits siderial,</li>
                    <li class="l">Move quick about each nimble ball.</li>

                    <li class="l">About this pair of burning-glasses.</li>
                    <li class="l">Two hemispheres, with two such suns,</li>
                    <li class="l">O’er microcosms seldom runs.</li>
                    <li class="l">Midst these twin-flames, a marble mount,</li>

                    <li class="l">On each side of which ridge you’ll spy,</li>
                    <li class="l">Aurora’s rosy blushes lie.</li>
                    <li class="l">Her sanguine cheeks, like two queen-apples,</li>
                    <li class="l">Nature’s great artist neatly couples.</li>
                    <li class="l">Her two ambrosial ruddy lips,</li>
                    <li class="l">In deepest scarlet dye she dips.</li>
                    <li class="l">Who views her well-set polished teeth,</li>
                    <li class="l">Will think two ranks of pearls he seeth.</li>
                    <li class="l">Twixt these matched milk-white ivory rows,</li>
                    <li class="l">A sweet breathed aromatic flows,</li>
                    <li class="l">All down ’long to her swan-like neck;</li>
                    <li class="l">Her fine complexion hath no speck.</li>
                    <li class="l">Her pair of round crowned rising hills,</li>
                    <li class="l">Each moment with new panting fills.</li>
                    <li class="l">Her sleek soft downy checkered wrists,</li>
                    <li class="l">Small azure threads finely entwists.</li>
                    <li class="l">Her lily hands, long woodbine fingers,</li>
                    <li class="l">Hang ever quivering, never lingers,</li>
                    <li class="l">In trembling strokes, which always she</li>
                    <li class="l">Tunes into sweetest harmony.</li>
                    <li class="l">I scarce e’er see them, but the sound,</li>
                    <li class="l">Of music seems thence to rebound.</li>
                    <li class="l">No unions [pearls], no choice jewels are</li>
                    <li class="l">Found anywhere, that may compare,</li>
                    <li class="l">With th’very nails, or joints, or bones,</li>
                    <li class="l">That her ten sister-fingers owns.</li>
                    <li class="l">You’d scarce know which are richest things,</li>
                    <li class="l">Her knuckle bones or diamond rings.</li>
                    <li class="l">More curious is each satin limb,</li>
                    <li class="l">Than th’ silken trails that cover him.</li>
                    <li class="l">Thus if you take her every way,</li>
                    <li class="l">How lovely she’s! what shall I say?</li>
                    <li class="l">Her head, her face, her every part,</li>
                    <li class="l">Most graceful was, there need no art,</li>
                    <li class="l">Be used at all her to adorn</li>
                    <li class="l">With paints or pearls, she being born,</li>
                    <li class="l">Nature’s own masterpiece: white skin,</li>
                    <li class="l">Rose lips, fair breasts, sweet smiles, and in</li>
                    <li class="l">Her gestures such a compound grace,</li>
                    <li class="l">Made her to beautify the place</li>
                    <li class="l">Where’er she came; her goodly look,</li>
                    <li class="l">At first sight the beholders took,</li>
                    <li class="l">And won their hearts immediately,</li>
