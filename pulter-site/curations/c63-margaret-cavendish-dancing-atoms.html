    <p>In lines 13-14 the speaker refers to a time after her death when she will be dispersed into atoms, even though she currently does not understand their movements or “dances.” Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, was one of several seventeenth-century writers who used the terminology of dancing atoms, which for her implied an orderly movement of the smallest particles that make up matter. In “A World made by Atomes” she depicts atoms fitting neatly into gaps and spaces in the world, and potentially creating a new world. In “Motion directs, while Atomes dance” atoms dance under the direction of motion, creating a kind of harmony that is good health. When atoms no longer dance together, the result is death.</p>

        <li class="l">We seeke out Stones, to fit that place withall.</li>

        <li class="l">They fall away, and cannot stay we see.</li>
        <li class="l">So <span class="it">Atomes</span>, as they dance, finde places fit,</li>
        <li class="l">They there remaine, lye close, and fast will sticke.</li>
        <li class="l">Those that unfit, the rest that rove about,</li>
        <li class="l">Do never leave, untill they thrust them out.</li>

        <li class="l">As severall work-men serve each others turnes.</li>
