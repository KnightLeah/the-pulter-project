  These two poems draw our attention to the racialized implications of Pulter’s key word in Poem 59: “fair.” In the “Song of Songs” from the Old Testament, one of the oldest and most influential blazons of a beloved’s attributes, the word “fair” seems to mean simply “beautiful.” In the lines excerpted here, a male lover praises the fairness of his beloved. In the first chapter of the “Song of Songs,” she refers to herself as “black, but comely”; she also praises her lover as “fair.” In the Old Testament, then, and the seventeenth-century English translation of it (the King James Version), fairness can correspond to blackness and can be used in praise of men or women. But, beginning in the mid-sixteenth century in English, fair emerges as a word for a light complexion, thus tying whiteness and beauty “just at the moment of intensified English interest in colonial travel and African trade;” increasingly, it is also applied only to women. As a consequence, English women’s “fairness” was set off by contrasting it  to “blackness,” both through figurations and in portraits that paired white sitters with their black servants and slaves (Kim F. Hall, <span class="it">Things of Darkness: Economies of Race and Gender in Early Modern England</span> [Cornell University Press, 1995], p. 3). Thus we find an emphasis on the white skin of the female beloved in Pulter’s various blazons and in Edward Phillips’ poem below, which returns repeatedly to his mistress’s white skin and refers disparagingly to “savages” and “Indians” by contrast.

    <li class="l">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</li>
    <li class="l">Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</li>
    <li class="l">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</li>
    <li class="l">Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</li>
    <li class="l">Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</li>
    <li class="l">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</li>
    <li class="l">Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</li>
    <li class="l">Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</li>
    <li class="l">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</li>
    <li class="l">How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</li>
    <li class="l">Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</li>
    <li class="l">A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</li>
    <li class="l">Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</li>
    <li class="l">Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</li>
    <li class="l">A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</li>
    <li class="l">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</li>
