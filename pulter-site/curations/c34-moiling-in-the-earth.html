      “Moiling in the earth,” as Pulter calls it in this poem, is the essence of human life, even if it is a distraction. The connection between humans and humus is older than Adam, whose name in Hebrew is a word play on the “ground” from which God shapes him (adam/adamah). In Genesis, when God explains to Adam and Eve the consequence of their sin, he reminds them “dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return” (King James Bible Genesis 3:19). That phrasing is condensed as the eternal cycle of human life: dust to dust. Dust is both our inevitable destiny and our point of origin. Dust is a beginning as well as an ending. I gather here reflections on soil, composting, and the fecundity of decay from the seventeenth century to the twentieth as a reminder of the long history of linking soil and rebirth, decomposition and regeneration.

          In the course of any imposing of order, whether in the mind or in the external world, the attitude to rejected bits and pieces goes through two stages. First they are recognisably out of place, a threat to good order, and so are regarded as objectionable and vigorously brushed away. At this stage they have some identity: They can be seen to be unwanted bits of whatever it was they came from, hair or food or wrappings. This is the stage at which they are dangerous; their half-identity still clings to them and the clarity of the scene in which they obtrude is impaired by their presence. But a long process of pulverizing, dissolving and rotting awaits any physical things that have been recognised as dirt. In the end, all identity is gone. The origin of the various bits and pieces is lost and they have entered into the mass of common rubbish. It is unpleasant to poke about in the refuse to try to recover anything, for this revives identity. So long as identity is absent, rubbish is not dangerous. It does not even create ambiguous perceptions since it clearly belongs in a defined place, a rubbish heap of one kind or another.  Even the bones of buried kings rouse little awe and the thought that the air is full of the dust of corpses of bygone races has no power to move. Where there is no differentiation there is no defilement.

          The soil is the great connector of lives, the source and destination of all. … It is alive itself. It is a grave, too, of course. Or a healthy soil is. It is full of dead animals and plants, bodies that have passed through other bodies. For except for some humans—with their sealed coffins and vaults, their pathological fear of the earth—the only way into the soil is through other bodies. But no matter how finely the dead are broken down, or how many times they are eaten, they yet give into other life. If healthy soil is full of death it is also full of life: worms, fungi, microorganisms of all kinds, for which, as for us humans, the dead bodies of the once living are a feast. Eventually this dead matter becomes soluble, available as food for plants, and life begins to rise up again, out of the soil into the light. Given only the health of the soil, nothing that dies is dead for very long. Within this powerful economy, it seems that death occurs only for the good of life. And having followed the cycle around, we see that we have not only a description of the fundamental biological process, but also a metaphor of great beauty and power.
