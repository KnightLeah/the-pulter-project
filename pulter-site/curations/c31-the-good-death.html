    <p>John Donne’s “Hymn to God, My God, in my Sickness” meditates upon the speaker’s illness, and imagines the microcosm of his body as a map of the newly-expanded world. In contemplating his own death, Donne’s speaker finds solace in the promise of Christ’s resurrection, a figure for the sinner’s own restoration under God at the final judgement.
