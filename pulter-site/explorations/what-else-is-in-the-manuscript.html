        When readers today encounter early modern poems in edited anthologies, we lose a sense of how their original physical format shaped their meanings. The poems presented in <span class="it">The Pulter Project</span> survive in only one known manuscript, a bound volume of 167 leaves in folio, catalogued as <span class="pre">MS Lt q 32</span> in the Brotherton Collection, <a href="https://library.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Leeds Library</a>. There are several loose sheets catalogued along with the volume. In 1975, the University of Leeds Library purchased the manuscript at a Christie’s auction from Sir Gilbert Inglefield, an architect, book collector, and former mayor of London. No records exist indicating how the manuscript made its way from Hertfordshire to London, or who owned it between the eighteenth century (when Pulter’s great-grandson signed it and an unknown hand added comments) and 1975.

        This Exploration invites you to understand more about the volume as a material artifact by exhibiting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          what is called the front matter, including title pages and inscriptions of material. In this book, which can be read (inverted) from either end, there is “front matter” at both ends; and
        </li>
        <li>
          writings added to the volume after the book’s production, including loose sheets catalogued with the volume.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To see facsimiles of the pages on which specific Pulter poems are written, see individual poem pages in <span class="it">The Pulter Project</span>, the University of Leeds site, or the poem facsimiles in the database <span class="it">Perdita Manuscripts: Women Writers, 1500-1700</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Exploration moves beyond the display of individual poems on manuscript pages in order to enable readers to get a sense of the material book object, including pages in which annotators have added poems, fragments of songs, accounts, practice writing, sayings, family genealogies, and historical information. Unless otherwise specified, all images are provided courtesy of the University of Leeds Library.

      <h3>About the Book</h3>
      <p>
        Bound in calf-skin which has the feel of suede, this 8” x 5” book is embossed with minimal blind-tooled lining (decorative impressions made with heated finishing tools) on the covers and spine. The binding is consistent with other seventeenth-century texts, and the cover, shown below, displays signs of deterioration:

      </div>
      <p>
        The gilt lettering on the spine of the volume, “Lady Hesther Pulter’s Poems,” was probably added after the book’s original binding, perhaps in the eighteenth century.

      </div>

      <p>
        At one end of the book, the reader finds three folios bearing titles and inscriptions, followed by 120 poems, almost all of which are written in the italic and decorative hand of a single (unidentified) scribe. The poems are divided into two sections:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          the first group of 62 poems (fol. 3r-88v) are variously titled “Poems Breathed forth By the Nobel Hadaſsas,” “Poems Breathed forth by the Hadaſsas Rt. Hon:,” and “Noble Hadassah Poems Wrighten By ye Rt Honerable H.P.”;
        </li>
        <li>
          the next group of 53 poems (fol. 91r-130v), are preceded by an internal title page. “Emblemes,” written in the scribal hand, is centered on fol. 90r in large script. In the top left corner, in what we take to be Pulter’s hand, there is a supplement to the title: “The ſighes of a ſad ſoule Emblimatically breath’d forth by the noble Hadaſsah.” Readers can see all of these pages below in this Exploration.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At the other end of the book (inverted or upside down) is an unfinished prose romance, “The Unfortunate Florinda Written by the Noble Hadaſsah.” Readers may consult the pages of the romance, which are not included here, on the University of Leeds Library site. While some manuscripts from this time period accreted new material added by many different people over a number of generations, Pulter’s poems were consciously and neatly gathered for presentation and are attributed almost entirely to one source.

        Reading the physical volume provides information that is not readily legible from facsimile photographs. For instance, there are several blank pages in the volume providing spacing between some poems (found on fols. 1v, 2v, 33v, 35v, 76v, 78v, 81, 86v, 87v, 90v, 129v, 131r, and 131v). Three leaves (fols. 85, 85, and 87) are from a thicker paper source and were “tipped in,” or glued in, after the book was bound. These leaves contain three poems: “On the Fall of that Grand Rebel the Earl of Eſsex his Effigies in harry the 7th’s Chappel in Westminster Abby” (Poem 62), an untitled poem with the first line, “Dear God from thy high Throne look down“ (Poem 63), and an untitled poem with the first line, “And must the ſword this controverce deſide” (Poem 64). Someone has torn leaves from the volume at various points (between fols. 6v and 7r; 34v and 35r; 50v and 51r; 56v and 57r), though no text appears to be missing.

      [OLD STUFF BELOW]
    </p>
    <p>
      We still have relatively few hard facts about Hester Pulter, especially relative to her male contemporaries, about whom more records tend to survive. Even something as fundamental as the year of her birth has been debated, as has the year of her marriage. Pulter herself may be said to have created some of the confusion around when she wed—or perhaps the blame lies instead with readers too eager to treat her poems as factual life-writings, when what they offer instead is more complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="/poems/32" title="Read “Aletheia’s Pearl” (Poem 32)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Aletheia’s Pearl</span><span class="idx">32</span></a>, the speaker laments that she has “lived a sad and weary life, / Thirteen a maid, and thirty three a wife.” The line has been taken as evidence that Pulter married at the age of thirteen—which, in her edition, Alice Eardley notes was “a particularly young age, even by the standards of the early seventeenth century” (p. 14). More recently, Kerry Plunkett discovered Pulter’s marriage record in the online genealogical database FamilySearch: this record shows that Pulter married at the age of fifteen—that is, if we accept the argument that Pulter was born in 1605. Alice Eardley summarizes the debate around evidence for Pulter’s date of birth, and makes a compelling argument for the year being 1605, in “Lady Hester Pulter’s Date of Birth,” <span class="it">Notes and Queries</span>, 57.4 (2010): 498–501. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more recently, to check the facts proffered by FamilySearch, we have examined in person the marriage record that survives in the parish register for the borough of Westbury. There, in Latin, is the following entry:
    </p>
    <div class="img-box">
      <img src="/explorations/img/hester-pulters-marriage-1.jpg">
      <p class="src">Parish Records of Westbury, Registers, 1556-1653, 1427/3. Image provided courtesy of Wiltshire and Swindon Archives.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This Latin text, “Arthurus Pulter et Hester Ley matrimiomi copulati sunt January quarto,” means, in English, “Arthur Pulter and Hester Ley were joined in marriage on the fourth of January.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The headers at the top of the same page confirm the year in which the marriage took place as 1620:
    </p>
    <div class="img-box">

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The record is mistranscribed in the genealogical databases Ancestry and FamilySearch, where “Pulter” appears as “Pulta”:

      <p class="src">Image provided courtesy of Kerry Plunkett.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The error is understandable, given the elision of the “e” and “r” in “Pulter:

    </div>
    <p>
      The marriage record is found in this volume:

    <div class="img-box">
      <img src="/explorations/img/hester-pulters-marriage-5.jpg">
      <p class="src">Parish Records of Westbury, Registers, 1556-1653, 1427/3. Image provided courtesy of Wiltshire & Swindon Archives.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The parish register—a large bound manuscript volume, comprising nearly a century’s records of local baptisms, marriages, and burials—is preserved in the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre in Chippenham, not far from Westbury, where Pulter’s father held a manor and served four times as member of Parliament, and where he and her mother were eventually buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      By moving from Pulter’s poem, to a transcription in an online database, and finally to the original document in which Hester Ley’s marriage to Arthur Pulter was recorded in 1620, we have confirmed as a matter of fact the precise date and place of her marriage.
