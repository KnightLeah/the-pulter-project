        <correction>
          <p>Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags. These annotations and may be futher explained within NOTE tags, as added by the editors of this digital edition, for display within the apparatus.</p>
        </correction>
        <normalization>
          <p>Original spellings, abbreviations, and orthography are preserved. Where in the manuscripts a character's status as majuscule or miniscule is ambiguous, the editor has silently chosen one or the other based on context and judgment (i.e., does not register such ambiguity in either the markup or the notes).</p>

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="headnote">Lying in her garden, Pulter finds herself the chosen umpire of a contest among a dozen flowers in this, her longest poem. Before she will choose a winner, she exhorts the disputants to describe their “virtues”—a word encompassing both moral and botanical meanings in a period when plants were key medicinal ingredients. As the garden members readily comply, Pulter is able to show off her extensive knowledge of botany (drawn from classical and contemporary natural histories and gardening manuals), especially its links to mythology, In addition to their role in health care, the plants concern themselves with their “color, beauty, fashion, smell”—alternately, as they speak in turn, vaunting themselves and mocking the other flowers’ grandiose claims each other. As well as a spirited contribution to the poetic genre of the debate, Pulter’s poem quietly critiques a parliamentary system in which representatives devote themselves to self-promotion and mud-slinging more than any larger truth. No wonder the umpire’s discreet choice, in the end, is to cut short this mockery of a parliament—perhaps a particularly happy ending for a royalist like Pulter, whose country’s parliament cut short her king’s life and the monarchy itself, leaving her party to take solace in rural retreats. This garden, ironically, provides little peace or quiet, instead subjecting weary humans to the energetic quarreling that they might go there to escape.</note>

In the manuscript, a blank space after “Micurella,” a lack of punctuation in these lines (as in most of Pulter’s poems), and potentially unusual syntax (as in our proposed editing) makes this passage difficult to parse.</note></seg>,</rdg>
