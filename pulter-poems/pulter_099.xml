            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote"><p>The rich complexity of this poem is best appreciated with reference both to Pulter’s other poems and to poems by other emblem writers. Accordingly, I’ve tried to contextualize the many images and concepts in this poem within the world of Pulter’s manuscript as well as the world of early modern English emblem books, sometimes by referencing an analogous poem or image, and sometimes an opposing one.</p><p>With an eye to the contemporary reader, I have modernized spelling, and inserted additional punctuation as needed to aid in understanding. As seventeenth-century writers often used capitalization for emphasis, though, I have tried to retain the manuscript’s original capitalization. The capitalization of some letters (e.g., “s”) is difficult to determine; in these cases, I have made individual determinations in line with Pulter’s style.</p>

              <note type="headnote">Which would you rather be: hog or dove? Pulter makes the choice even easier than it might first seem with her contrasting portraits of the dietary habits of each creature. Grunting hogs root for nuts with their snouts in the dirt, never even thinking to thank those who made them fall to the ground in the first place, while turtledoves alternate between dainty sips, grateful prayers, and thoughts of still higher things than mere food and drink. But then comes the twist: doves, though innocent, are often sacrificial victims, while hogs, through no virtue of their own, have the good fortune to be banned from the altar. This is the moral quandary on which Pulter’s final invocation turns: knowing all this, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> which would you rather be? She claims the choice remains clear.</note>

              <note type="headnote">
                  <p>Emblem 34 is a stellar example both of Pulter’s love for antithesis, and of her innovative approach toward emblems. The poem is structurally divided into two parts: the first twelve lines elaborating upon a “thankless” hog as an emblem of worldliness, and the concluding ten lines interpreting a “Chaste and constant Turtle Dove” as an emblem of people rightly focused on “Celestial Joys.” This contrapuntal structure—unusual, though not unknown, for emblem poems—would seem to suggest a relatively even-handed depiction of two contrasting spiritual perspectives. But lines 19-20, asking the reader to choose between “<hi rend="italic">base</hi> Hogs or Turtle Doves” (emphasis added), are representative of the poem as the whole in clearly indicating the doves’ superiority (even if that means contradicting Pulter’s likely source).</p>
                  <p>In so presenting the contrast between these two animals, Emblem 34 is the structural opposite of <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="101">Emblem 36</ref>, which begins lauding constant turtledoves, and ends castigating the “swine” who profane God’s temple. The poems are best read in conjunction, and together demonstrate competing, yet equally valid attitudes toward earthly chaos. By its conclusion, Emblem 36 becomes mired in political diatribe--as stuck in the mire of the civil wars, one could say, as pigs in a mudpit. Emblem 34, however, avoids explicit political commentary. It exhibits precisely the transcendence of earthly concerns represented by the turtledove, focusing on future promises that obviate earthly pain and suffering.</p>
                  <p>Hogs are an appropriate antithesis to this faithful turtledove, for they have a long biblical and polemical association with immoral behavior.<seg>1<note type="gloss">I distinguish between “hogs,” domesticated animals like those Pulter depicts, and “boars,” which are almost always invoked so as to privilege their wildness (see the definitions and examples given in <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> “hog,” n.1 vs. “boar,” n.). This association with wildness means that boars have their own complex biblical, moral, and polemical history, which is not examined here.</note></seg> George Wither’s <hi rend="title">Collection of Emblems</hi> (1635), for instance, implicitly references Matthew 7:6, which injoins people not to cast pearls before swine. Wither emphasizes the socioeconomic implications of this injunction, depicting a hog with a pearl ring balanced on its nose in order to critique those who misuse the privileges given to them by fortune (224).</p>
                  <p>If hogs are commonplace in emblem literature, though, Pulter’s choice of the turtledove itself is not. Constancy, a notoriously multifaceted concept, is typically an immobile virtue.<seg>1<note type="gloss">Consider, for instance, the Son in Milton’s <hi rend="title">Paradise Regained</hi>: Satan describes his battle against the Son as “try[ing] / his constancy,” and the Son achieves victory simply by standing still (2.225-6). For more on constancy and its literary representations, see Rachel Zhang, “The Constant Paradox: Constancy, Genre, and Literary Tradition in the English Civil Wars” (PhD diss., Columbia University, 2018).</note></seg> Often defined as remaining faithful to a person or idea despite inducements to the contrary (see <hi rend="title">OED</hi>, n.1, n.2), constancy is usually depicted in emblems as a person or animal actively refusing to move. For example, Geoffrey Whitney in <hi rend="title">A Choice of Emblemes</hi> (1586) explains that Aesculapius’ “sittinge, shewes he must be setled still / With constant minde” (212).<seg>1<note type="gloss">Similarly, in another poem, Whitney presents fishermen who “constant stande[s], abyding sweete or sower, / Untill the Lord appoynte an happie hower” (<hi rend="title">Choice of Emblemes</hi>, 97).</note></seg> Indeed, where constancy is immobile, it is inconstancy which moves, as demonstrated by Henry Peacham’s emblem of “Inconstancia” in <hi rend="title">Minerva Britanna</hi> (1612): “never at a stay,” like the zodiac Cancer, who “Forward, and backward,...keepes his pace” (147).</p>
                  <p>Pulter’s depiction of “the Chaste and constant Turtle Dove” is then exceedingly unusual in emblem literature, although widespread in her own poetry (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="46">The Lark</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="57">Why must I be forever thus confined</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-" corresp="85">Emblem 20</ref>, Emblem 36).<seg>1<note type="gloss">The turtledove also embodies constancy in Shakespeare’s “The Phoenix and the Turtle,” where the death of the birds also means the death of “Love and constancy” (22).</note></seg> Pulter’s depictions often highlight the bird’s mobility, even though the dove innately implies a volatility anathema to typical representations of constancy. In “Why must I be forever thus confined,” for instance, Pulter writes, “Though she resolves to have no second mate / Yet she her flight about the air doth take,” contrasting the dove’s “freedom [to] freely both enjoy and love” to the poet’s own confinement (67-8, 76-9). This avian transcendence is precisely the picture of constancy we see in Emblem 34. Just as the dove flies upward in Pulter’s lyric, the emblem’s turtledoves “turn their thoughts to true celestial joys,” thereby transcending the evils of this world. This transcendent mobility once again contrasts with the hog, who are so stubbornly rooted to the earth that they cannot get their snouts out of the muck.</p>
                  <p>This transcendence is muted, though, by the poem’s acknowledgement of pain and suffering. The poem’s final lines, which repeat Pulter’s nearly unprecedented tendency to end her emblem poems focusing on herself, underscore the possibility of martyrdom (another situation commonly associated with constancy in emblem books).<seg>1<note type="gloss">See George Wither, <hi rend="title">A Collection of Emblems</hi> (1635), 81.</note></seg> True joy, Pulter suggests, is a party to suffering, and transcendence often comes by one’s own sacrifice. The return to the speaker personalizes this message, and suggests that she has already accepted suffering for her own life.</p></note>

Matthew 6:19-21, for instance, reminds readers, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”</p>

            <rdg wit="#ae">Even so voluptuous <seg>Gallants<note type="gloss">“Gallants” is a multi-valent term in Pulter’s poetry, having both positive connotations (e.g., <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7">On those Two Unparalleled Friends</ref>, ll. 14, 24) and negative (e.g., <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="74">Emblem 8</ref>, ll. 12, 22).

            <rdg wit="#ae">Which takes a Sip then <seg>throws her eyes above<note type="gloss"><p>Pulter’s depiction of the turtle dove as constantly gazing heavenward actually contradicts her most likely source, Pliny the Elder’s <hi rend="title">Natural History</hi> (from which Pulter frequently draws). According to Philemon Holland’s 1601 translation, Pliny describes doves as “drinking not to hold up their bills between-whiles, and draw their necks backe, but to take a large draught at once, as horses and kine do.” Pliny, <hi rend="title">Historie of the World</hi>, 1:290. Pulter’s turtledoves, however, look up, in direct contrast to the hogs “rooting” in the ground.</p><p>Henry Peacham similarly aligns the turtledove with piety in <hi rend="title">Minerva Britanna</hi>, comparing it to a “godly wight, whome no delight of Sinne, Doth with vaine pleasure draw: or worldly care,” esteeming “these fleeting joies a pinne” (110).</p></note></seg>,</rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>God’s Children here but Sip of Terrene toys<note type="gloss">Picking up on the metaphor of Christians as God’s “children,” Pulter compares things we know on Earth, things that are “terrene”—that is, “of the earth; worldly, secular, temporal, material, human” (<hi rend="title">OED</hi>, a.1)—to the insignificant, infantile “toys” children play with. In doing so, Pulter draws a contrast between two different types of children: one childish only in relation to God the father, and the other childish by virtue of their earthly perspective.</note></seg>,</rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>When Hogs his Sacred Altar come not Nigh<note type="gloss">Pigs, declared unclean by God in Leviticus 11:7, were utterly forbidden to Jews, and therefore banned from approaching God’s “sacred Altar.” Isaiah 66:3 references the killing of swine as epitomizing people's wickedness, an identification emblematized in George Wither’s <hi rend="title">A Collection of Emblems</hi> (1635), 38. But it is the evil of the hogs themselves, not the people using them, that seems the focus of Pulter’s ire here. Pulter draws a clear contrast between the hogs, which must remain distant from the temple, and the doves, which are willingly, sacrificially at the center of the temple’s activity.</note></seg>.</rdg>

Hogs are “base”—that is, distant from God in their depravity (see <hi rend="title">OED</hi>, adj. A.II.10)—while doves stand alone in their heavenly virtue. “Base,” indicating the pigs’ low position relative to the ground, also reinforces the animals’ physical distinction, between the mobile, transcendent dove and the earth-bound swine (see <hi rend="title">OED</hi> “base,” adj.

In this case, the return effectively underscores the poem’s emblematic moral while highlighting the personal sacrifice involved in living out that moral.</note></seg>.</rdg>
