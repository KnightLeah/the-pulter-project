          <p>Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags. These annotations and may be futher explained within NOTE tags, as added by the editors of this digital edition, for display within the apparatus.</p>

          <p>Original spellings, abbreviations, and orthography are preserved.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
              <note type="headnote">This fragment of a poem, in what is probably Pulter’s hand, appears on a loose sheet in a folder associated with the bound volume in which her other poems are found. Although a complete copy might someday be found, Pulter appears not to have finished this experimental dream vision about a relatively recent event: the 1667 battle, known as the Raid on the Medway, which ended in the destruction by the Dutch navy of the fort and shipyard at Sheerness, on England’s east coast. Part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, this was one of the worst defeats ever suffered by the British navy, which saw many warships destroyed or captured and the hasty arrangement by Charles II of an unfavorable treaty. The few extant verses of what promises an epic treatment of these events are framed by the speaker’s recurrent nightmare visions which mingle her distress with an incongruous perception of Sheerness remaining “unconquered” despite the “purple gore” that sprinkles the sea. The speaker’s horrified amazement joins that of the powerful and resplendent water gods and goddesses, mustering (too late, it must be said) as British reinforcements under Saturn’s command. Neptune, Triton, Nereus, Doris: the speaker, perched on a rock above the fray, witnesses a catalogue of mythic powerhouses whom she has imaginatively installed into current political events. What dreamy counterfactual scenario might have ensued, if the poem continued past its opening catalogue and into the martial action one might expect to follow? We will only know if the poem’s continuation one day comes to light.</note>
